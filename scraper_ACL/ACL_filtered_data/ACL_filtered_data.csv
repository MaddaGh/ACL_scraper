"Fair Enough: Standardizing Evaluation and Model Selection for Fairness Research in {NLP}"",","2023"",","Association for Computational Linguistics"",","https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.23/"",","10.18653/v1/2023.eacl-main.23"",","Modern NLP systems exhibit a range of biases, which a growing literature on model debiasing attempts to correct. However, current progress is hampered by a plurality of definitions of bias, means of quantification, and oftentimes vague relation between debiasing algorithms and theoretical measures of bias. This paper seeks to clarify the current situation and plot a course for meaningful progress in fair learning, with two key contributions: (1) making clear inter-relations among the current gamut of methods, and their relation to fairness theory; and (2) addressing the practical problem of model selection, which involves a trade-off between fairness and accuracy and has led to systemic issues in fairness research. Putting them together, we make several recommendations to help shape future work."
"The Functional Relevance of Probed Information: A Case Study"",","2023"",","Association for Computational Linguistics"",","https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.58/"",","10.18653/v1/2023.eacl-main.58"",","Recent studies have shown that transformer models like BERT rely on number information encoded in their representations of sentences’ subjects and head verbs when performing subject-verb agreement. However, probing experiments suggest that subject number is also encoded in the representations of all words in such sentences. In this paper, we use causal interventions to show that BERT only uses the subject plurality information encoded in its representations of the subject and words that agree with it in number. We also demonstrate that current probing metrics are unable to determine which words’ representations contain functionally relevant information. This both provides a revised view of subject-verb agreement in language models, and suggests potential pitfalls for current probe usage and evaluation."
"Exploring Category Structure with Contextual Language Models and Lexical Semantic Networks"",","2023"",","Association for Computational Linguistics"",","https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.167/"",","10.18653/v1/2023.eacl-main.167"",","The psychological plausibility of word embeddings has been studied through different tasks such as word similarity, semantic priming, and lexical entailment. Recent work on predicting category structure with word embeddings report low correlations with human ratings. (Heyman and Heyman, 2019) showed that static word embeddings fail at predicting typicality using cosine similarity between category and exemplar words, while (Misra et al., 2021)obtain equally modest results for various contextual language models (CLMs) using a Cloze task formulation over hand-crafted taxonomic sentences. In this work, we test a wider array of methods for probing CLMs for predicting typicality scores. Our experiments, using BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), show the importance of using the right type of CLM probes, as our best BERT-based typicality prediction methods improve on previous works. Second, our results highlight the importance of polysemy in this task, as our best results are obtained when contextualization is paired with a disambiguation mechanism as in (Chronis and Erk, 2020). Finally, additional experiments and analyses reveal that Information Content-based WordNet (Miller, 1995) similarities with disambiguation match the performance of the best BERT-based method, and in fact capture complementary information, and when combined with BERT allow for enhanced typicality predictions."
"3{D} Rotation and Translation for Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embedding"",","2024"",","Association for Computational Linguistics"",","https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.90/"",","10.18653/v1/2024.eacl-long.90"",","The main objective of Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations, enabling the prediction of missing facts. A significant challenge in achieving better KG embeddings lies in capturing relation patterns, including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, commutative composition, non-commutative composition, hierarchy, and multiplicity. This study introduces a novel model called 3H-TH (3D Rotation and Translation in Hyperbolic space) that captures these relation patterns simultaneously. In contrast, previous attempts have not achieved satisfactory performance across all the mentioned properties at the same time. The experimental results demonstrate that the new model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, hierarchy property, and other relation patterns in low-dimensional space, meanwhile performing similarly in high-dimensional space."
