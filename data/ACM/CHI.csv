However, anticipating these impacts remains challenging, as computing researchers often do not have access to diverse perspectives. Here, we explore how computing researchers brainstorm the negative societal impacts of computing innovations using a multi-agent dialog prototype called Weaver as a probe that represents synthetic stakeholder conversations. Through think-aloud sessions and interviews with 12 participants, we evaluate how computing researchers perceive and engage with such a system, and whether they find it beneficial compared to using no such system or using ChatGPT. Our findings revealed that participants valued the conversations with the multi-agent system and considered societal impacts from new angles. Participants reported gaining insights and agency to reflect on issues rather than passively consuming pre-generated content. We discuss the findings, implications, and next steps for using a multi-agent system to brainstorm about the societal impacts of computing technologies.",Proceedings of the Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,497,7,"Multi-agent systems, Brainstorming, Human-AI Interaction, LLM",,CHI EA '25,

Currently, the most common approach to revisiting past moments is viewing photos and videos. These 2D media capture past events that reflect a recorder’s first-person perspective. The development of technology for accurately capturing 3D content presents an opportunity for new types of memory reliving, allowing greater immersion without perspective limitations. In this work, we adopt 2D and 3D moment-recording techniques and build a moment-reliving experience in AR that combines both display methods. Specifically, we use AR glasses to record 2D point-of-view (POV) videos, and volumetric capture to reconstruct 3D moments in AR. We allow seamless switching between AR and POV videos to enable immersive moment reliving and viewing of high-resolution details. Users can also navigate to a specific point in time using playback controls.

In this work, we conduct a survey to see how multiplicity impacts lay stakeholders’ – i.e., decision subjects’ – perceptions of ML fairness, and which approaches to address multiplicity they prefer. We investigate how these perceptions are modulated by task characteristics (e.g., stakes and uncertainty). Survey respondents think that multiplicity threatens the fairness of model outcomes, but not the appropriateness of using the model, even though existing work suggests the opposite. Participants are strongly against resolving multiplicity by using a single model (effectively ignoring multiplicity) or by randomizing the outcomes.

Furthermore, animism that supports heterogeneous multiplicity offers unique opportunities to stimulate human creativity through embodied engagement with an ecology of things. To demonstrate the concept of heterogeneous multiplicity, the authors present a speculative design project, AniThings, that intertwines multiple animistic collaborators to position activities of digital resource discovery and curation beyond the narrow domain of recommendation engines and personal feeds. The project illustrates an ecology of six tangible, interactive objects that, respectively, draw from a variety of digital resources and inhabit a range of variously positioned stances towards their human collaborators and each other.

We conduct three experiments to investigate the impact of the visual representation on the decision-making strategies that people adopt. Our results suggest that participants adopt conservative decision-making strategies (i.e. place greater weight on the worst-case forecast than the best-case forecast) for both p-boxes and ensembles if the set of forecasts are uniformly distributed.

However, recent privacy legislature such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) restricts the storage of information that identify individuals. Obtaining permissions to store information about individuals can be bureaucratic and time-consuming. Anonymous schemes such as self-generated ids and machine generated ids have been proposed. However, self-generated linking ids demand effort from the participants, while machine assisted schemes typically generate long and incomprehensible ids. Consequently, there is a risk that students and researchers will limit their research to single-session experiments to avoid privacy issues. To simplify the administration of small multi-session experiments, the HIDE procedure is proposed for generating short human readable ids for linking participants across multiple sessions while maintaining anonymity and being robust to input errors. The approach is different from previous approaches in that the goal is to minimize the length of the linking ids. First, the procedure converts the participant's name into a phonetic representation. Next, this phonetic representation is hashed, and a truncated snippet of the hash is used as the linking id. HIDE is initialized by searching for a salt (a random data added to the hash input) that minimizes the id lengths. Experiments show that the procedure is capable of coding small experiments with 20 participants using two digits, and experiments of around 200 participants with four digits. An implementation of the procedure has been made available through a simple web interface. It is hoped that the procedure can help students and HCI researchers collect more comprehensive data by following participants over time, while protecting their privacy.",Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,326,6,"GDPR, Hashing, Longitudinal studies, Multi session experiments, Privacy, Record linking, Soundex","Yokohama, Japan",CHI EA '21,2541–2550

We conducted another experiment where the same participants did identical metacognitive description tasks about half a year after the previous experiment.

Second monitors are generally used for secondary activities related to principal tasks, for peripheral awareness of information that is not the main focus, and for easy access to resources. A second monitor improves efficiency in ways that are difficult to measure yet can have substantial subjective benefit.

Through semi-structured interviews with eight participants with low vision, we identified challenges, such as reliance on assistance, inaccessible platform interfaces, and difficulties in offline tasks. The study highlights the need for AI-powered assistive tools, accessible design improvements, and integrated post-sale management systems.

When fetching packages, people usually need to go to collection sites of their apartment complexes or a KuaiDiGui, an increasingly popular type of self-service package pickup machine. However, little is known whether such processes are accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) city dwellers. We interviewed BLV people (N=20) living in a large metropolitan area in China to understand their practices and challenges of fetching packages. Our findings show that participants encountered difficulties in finding the collection site and localizing and recognizing their packages. When fetching packages from KuaiDiGuis, they had difficulty in identifying the correct KuaiDiGui, interacting with its touch screen, navigating the complex on-screen workflow, and opening the target compartment. We discuss design considerations to make the package fetching process more accessible to the BLV community.",Proceedings of the 2022 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,268,15,"Accessibility, Blind and low vision, China, Interview, KuaiDiGui, Package delivery, People with vision impairments, Qualitative study","New Orleans, LA, USA",CHI '22,458–465

Instead packages allow users to add new features to their documents while already working on them. They can match the features to their current task at hand. Supporting the reprogrammable nature of Codestrates, new features can also be implemented by users themselves and shared with other people without having to leave the document. We illustrate the application of Codestrate Packages in an example scenario and present its technical concepts.
