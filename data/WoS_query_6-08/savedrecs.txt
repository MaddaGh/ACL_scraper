However, engagement with heritage theory has only recently been addressed in HCI design, resulting in some previous work reinforcing the same realities that designers set out to challenge. There is need for an approach that supports designers in heritage settings in working critically with polyvocality to capture values, knowledges, and authorised narratives and reflect on how these are negotiated and presented in the designs created. We contribute "Designing with Genius Loci" (DwGL)-our proposed approach to co-design for polyvocality. We conceptualised DwGL through long-term engagement with volunteers and staff at a UK heritage site. First, we used ongoing recruitment to incentivise participation. We held a series of making workshops to explore participants' attitudes towards authorised narratives. We built participants' commitments to collaboration by introducing the common goal of creating an interactive digital design. Finally, as we designed, we enacted our own commitments to the heritage research and to participants' experiences. These four steps form the backbone of our proposed approach and serve as points of reflexivity. We applied DwGL to co-creating three designs: Un/Authorised View, SDH Palimpsest and Loci Stories, which we present in an annotated portfolio. Grounded in research through design, we reflect on working with the proposed approach and provide three lessons learned, guiding further research efforts in this design space: (1) creating a conversation between authorised and personal heritage stories; (2) designing using polyvocality negotiates voices; and (3) designs engender existing qualities and values. The proposed approach places polyvocality foremost in interactive heritage interpretation and facilitates valuable discussions between the designers and communities involved.									5	0	0	0	0	0	6				2414-4088										Univ Luxembourg, C2DH, L-4365 Esch Sur Alzette, LuxembourgNorthumbria Univ, Comp & Informat Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, EnglandNewcastle Univ, Sch Comp, Open Lab, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE4 5TG, Tyne & Wear, England				2022-07-06	WOS:000818406800001

One contributing factor for efficiency is polysemy which refers to reusing representamens of signs in different contexts. Two different types of polysemy are identified: ambiguous polysemy which encodes a view from part signs to compound signs and simultaneous polysemy for analysing how compound signs simultaneously denote more than one meaning. Two detailed examples are included.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1012-2443	1573-7470										Ostfalia Univ, Fak Informat, Wolfenbuttel, Germany	Ostfalia Univ			2022-04-26	WOS:000783737800001

Existing works tend to assume that the same verb has similar visual characteristics in different HOI categories, an approach that ignores the diverse semantic meanings of the verb. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net) that decodes the visual polysemy of verbs for HOI detection in three distinct ways. First, we refine features for HOI detection to be polysemy-aware through the use of two novel modules: namely, Language Prior-guided Channel Attention (LPCA) and Language Prior-based Feature Augmentation (LPFA). LPCA highlights important elements in human and object appearance features for each HOI category to be identified; moreover, LPFA augments human pose and spatial features for HOI detection using language priors, enabling the verb classifiers to receive language hints that reduce intra-class variation for the same verb. Second, we introduce a novel Polysemy-Aware Modal Fusion module, which guides PD-Net to make decisions based on feature types deemed more important according to the language priors. Third, we propose to relieve the verb polysemy problem through sharing verb classifiers for semantically similar HOI categories. Furthermore, to expedite research on the verb polysemy problem, we build a new benchmark dataset named HOI-VerbPolysemy (HOI-VP), which includes common verbs (predicates) that have diverse semantic meanings in the real world. Finally, through deciphering the visual polysemy of verbs, our approach is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on the HICO-DET, V-COCO, and HOI-VP databases.

J	Haber, Janosch; Poesio, Massimo				Poesio, Massimo/LIF-5376-2024						Polysemy-Evidence from Linguistics, Behavioral Science, and Contextualized Language Models								COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS				50	1			351	417				10.1162/coli_a_00500							Article	MAR 1 2023	2023	Polysemy is the type of lexical ambiguity where a word has multiple distinct but related interpretations. In the past decade, it has been the subject of a great many studies across multiple disciplines including linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics, which have made it increasingly clear that the complexity of polysemy precludes simple, universal answers, especially concerning the representation and processing of polysemous words. But fuelled by the growing availability of large, crowdsourced datasets providing substantial empirical evidence; improved behavioral methodology; and the development of contextualized language models capable of encoding the fine-grained meaning of a word within a given context, the literature on polysemy recently has developed more complex theoretical analyses.In this survey we discuss these recent contributions to the investigation of polysemy against the backdrop of a long legacy of research across multiple decades and disciplines. Our aim is to bring together different perspectives to achieve a more complete picture of the heterogeneity and complexity of the phenomenon of polysemy. Specifically, we highlight evidence supporting a range of hybrid models of the mental processing of polysemes. These hybrid models combine elements from different previous theoretical approaches to explain patterns and idiosyncrasies in the processing of polysemous that the best known models so far have failed to account for. Our literature review finds that (i) traditional analyses of polysemy can be limited in their generalizability by loose definitions and selective materials; (ii) linguistic tests provide useful evidence on individual cases, but fail to capture the full range of factors involved in the processing of polysemous sense extensions; and (iii) recent behavioral (psycho) linguistics studies, large-scale annotation efforts, and investigations leveraging contextualized language models provide accumulating evidence suggesting that polysemous sense similarity covers a wide spectrum between identity of sense and homonymy-like unrelatedness of meaning.We hope that the interdisciplinary account of polysemy provided in this survey inspires further fundamental research on the nature of polysemy and better equips applied research to deal with the complexity surrounding the phenomenon, for example, by enabling the development of benchmarks and testing paradigms for large language models informed by a greater portion of the rich evidence on the phenomenon currently available.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0891-2017	1530-9312										Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Chattermill, London, EnglandQueen Mary Univ London, London, EnglandUniv Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands				2023-03-01	WOS:001205186000003		
J									Thelma Silveira da Mota Lessa da Fonseca; Rafael Amaral Hyertquist Bordini		Nietzsche and the becoming: criticism the truth and the unfinished of the perspectivism																												Awarded Grant	Jul 01 2013	2013	This research project intends to show that Nietzsche has traced the paths of Heraclitus becoming over the course of his work, and it is accurately this influence that Heraclitus exercised on Nietzsche's philosophy that provides subsidies for this current work. The first goal will be to go through Nietzsche's critics to the idea of truth. Nietzsche endorses a motion for disputation of interpretations on the detriment of a system of inalienable truths or of a theory of knowledge. The philosopher is positioned in the benefit of the "perspectivism" contrary to the belief of a finished truth and free of questioning. The purpose in its first stage will be to understand how we can assign the Heraclitus becoming to a two-way street, of which Nietzsche appropriates to conduct his criticism of truth, and also, to what extent, the becoming is the bottom line for the formulation of his "perspectivism". The second stage, is intended to propose a detailed argument starting from this idea of "perspectivism", and then the problem: the "perspectivism" wouldn't suggest a kind of inverted theory of knowledge, which is what Nietzsche strongly criticized?(AU)									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						12/20446-0								Centro de Educação e Ciências Humanas (CECH).

Based on the synergetic theory of language, it is hypothesized that a word which occurs in more syntactic contexts, i.e. it has a higher degree, should be more polysemous and have more synonyms than a word which occurs in less syntactic contexts, i.e. it has a lesser degree. Six languages are used for hypotheses testing and, tentatively, the hypotheses are corroborated. The analysis of syntactic dependency networks presented in this study brings a new interpretation of the well-known relationship between frequency and polysemy (or synonymy).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2055-7671	2055-768X										Univ Ostrava, Dept Czech Language, Realni 5, CZ-70103 Ostrava, Czech RepublicComenius Univ, Dept Appl Math & Stat, Bratislava, SlovakiaCharles Univ Prague, Inst Formal & Appl Linguist, Prague, Czech RepublicMasaryk Univ, Nat Language Proc Ctr, Brno, Czech Republic				2017-04-26	WOS:000398126100003

It aims to represent each word by a vector so such that the geometry between these vectors can capture the semantic correlations between words. An ambiguous word can often have diverse meanings in different contexts, a quality which is called polysemy. The bulk of studies aimed to generate only one single embedding for each word, whereas a few studies have made a small number of embeddings to present different meanings of each word. However, it is hard to determine the exact number of senses for each word, as meanings depend on contexts. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel adaptive cross-contextual word embedding (ACWE) method for capturing the word polysemy in different contexts based on topic modeling, in which the word polysemy is defined over a latent interpretable semantic space. The proposed ACWE consists of two main parts, in the first of which an unsupervised cross-contextual probabilistic word embedding model is designed to obtain the global word embeddings, and each word is represented by an embedding in the unified latent semantic space. Based on the global word embeddings, an adaptive cross-contextual word embedding process is then devised in the second part to learn the local embeddings for each polysemous word in different contexts. In fact, a word embedding is adaptively adjusted and updated with respect to different contexts to generate different word embeddings tailored to the corresponding contexts. The proposed ACWE is validated on two datasets collected from Wikipedia and IMDb on different tasks including word similarity, polysemy induction, semantic interpretability, and text classification. Experimental results indicate that ACWE does not only outperform the established word embedding methods, which consider word polysemy on six popular benchmark datasets, but it also yields competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches without considering polysemy. Moreover, the proposed ACWE significantly improves the performances of text classification both in precision and F1, and the visualizations of the semantics of words demonstrate the feasibility and advantage of the proposed ACWE model on polysemy.

The aim is to distinguish and characterize broad classes, such as qualitative (gran 'big') and relational (pulmonar 'pulmonary') adjectives, as well as to identify polysemous adjectives such as economic ('economic vertical bar cheap'). We specifically aim at modeling regular polysemy, that is, types of sense alternations that are shared across lemmata. To date, both semantic classes for adjectives and regular polysemy have only been sparsely addressed in empirical computational linguistics.Two main specific questions are tackled in this article. First, what is an adequate broad semantic classification for adjectives? We provide empirical support for the qualitative and relational classes as defined in theoretical work, and uncover one type of adjective that has not received enough attention, namely, the event-related class. Second, how is regular polysemy best modeled in computational terms? We present two models, and argue that the second one, which models regular polysemy in terms of simultaneous membership to multiple basic classes, is both theoretically and empirically more adequate than the first one, which attempts to identify independent polysemous classes. Our best classifier achieves 69.1% accuracy, against a 51% baseline.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0891-2017	1530-9312										Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Translat & Language Sci, Barcelona 08018, SpainUniv Stuttgart, D-7000 Stuttgart, GermanyUniv Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain				2012-10-03	WOS:000308083100005

In contrast, a multi-perspective image combines what is seen from several viewpoints into a single image. Despite their incongruity of view, effective multi-perspective images are able to preserve spatial coherence and can depict, within a single context, details of a scene that are simultaneously inaccessible from a single view, yet easily interpretable by a viewer. In computer vision, multi-perspective images have been used for analysing structure revealed via motion and generating panoramic images with a wide field-of-view using mirrors.In this STAR, we provide a practical guide on topics in multi-perspective modelling and rendering methods and multi-perspective imaging systems. We start with a brief review of multi-perspective image techniques frequently employed by artists such as the visual paradoxes of Escher, the Cubism of Picasso and Braque and multi-perspective panoramas in cel animations. We then characterize existing multi-perspective camera models, with an emphasis on their underlying geometry and image properties. We demonstrate how to use these camera models for creating specific multi-perspective rendering effects. Furthermore, we show that many of these cameras satisfy the multi-perspective stereo constraints and we demonstrate several multi-perspective imaging systems for extracting 3D geometry for computer vision.The participants learn about topics in multi-perspective modelling and rendering for generating compelling pictures for computer graphics and in multi-perspective imaging for extracting 3D geometry for computer vision. We hope to provide enough fundamentals to satisfy the technical specialist without intimidating curious digital artists interested in multi-perspective images.The intended audience includes digital artists, photographers and computer graphics and computer vision researchers using or building multi-perspective cameras. They will learn about multi-perspective modelling and rendering, along with many real world multi-perspective imaging systems.									8	1	0	0	0	0	14			0167-7055	1467-8659										Univ Delaware, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Newark, DE 19716 USAUniv N Carolina, Dept Comp Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USAINRIA Grenoble Rhone Alpes, Montbonnot St Martin, France	INRIA Grenoble Rhone Alpes			2010-01-01	WOS:000274388400017

We propose a novel experimental setup for analyzing this knowledge in LMs specifically trained for different languages (English, French, Spanish, and Greek) and in multilingual BERT. We perform our analysis on datasets carefully designed to reflect different sense distributions, and control for parameters that are highly correlated with polysemy such as frequency and grammatical category. We demonstrate that BERT-derived representations reflect words' polysemy level and their partitionability into senses. Polysemy-related information is more clearly present in English BERT embeddings, but models in other languages also manage to establish relevant distinctions between words at different polysemy levels. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the knowledge encoded in contextualized representations and open up new avenues for multilingual lexical semantics research.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31				2307-387X										Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, LISN, F-91400 Orsay, FranceUniv Helsinki, Dept Digital Humanities, Helsinki, Finland				2022-03-02	WOS:000751952200050

However, applying OM for decision-making requires imitating human brain reasoning for more pragmatic results. Analyzing opinions with human-like intelligence is vital for avoiding misleading results. This occurs when the process can properly excogitate social influence and environmental uncertainty. In this study, an OM model for Twitter is proposed to handle perspectivism and opinion ambiguity. For perspectivism, social network analysis (SNA) is conducted, where users are ranked and then weighted using the UCINET tool and neural networks. An uncertainty classifier is used to integrate users' influence levels with the polarity scores of their texts, providing a new polarity score that can reflect the real-world reasoning of opinions. The polarity scores needed for integration are done using the lexicon resource TextBlob. In the proposed model, three uncertainty classifiers are tested: type1 fuzzy logic (T1-FL), type2 fuzzy logic (T2-FL), and neutrosophic logic (NL). A comparative analysis of the methods shows the ability of NL to deal with the uncertainty existing in the data more accurately, proving the benefit of NL in improving the power of OM in social media.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2169-3536											Alexandria Univ, Inst Grad Studies & Res, Dept Informat Technol, Alexandria 21526, EgyptHigher Inst Comp & Informat Syst, Alexandria 21913, Egypt	Higher Inst Comp & Informat Syst			2022-06-29	WOS:000814537900001

The goal of this formalism is, given a prepositional phrase, to define its possible spatial interpretations. For this, we propose to characterize spatial prepositions by means of a triplet (image schema, semantic feature, spatial axis). The core of SSP is predicate grounding theories, which are formulas of a first-order language that define a spatial preposition through the semantic features of its trajector and landmark. Precisifications are also established, which are a set of formulae of a qualitative spatial reasoning formalism that aims to provide the spatial characterization of the trajector with respect to the landmark. In addition to the theoretical model, we also present results of a computational implementation of SSP for the preposition 'in'.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0955-792X	1465-363X										Univ Paulista UNIP, Inst Ciencias Exatas & Tecnol, Rua Paz 797, BR-04713001 Sao Paulo, BrazilFlinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, 1284 South Rd, Tonsley, SA 5042, AustraliaCtr Univ FEI, Av Humberto AC Branco,3972 SBC, BR-09850901 Sao Paulo, BrazilUniv Sao Paulo, Dept Linguist, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, SP, BrazilUniv Leeds, Sch Comp, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandCtr Study Language & Informat, Stanford, CA 94305 USAUniv Adelaide, Dept Philosophy, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia	Ctr Study Language & Informat			2020-06-11	WOS:000536503000004

The functional polysemy of this lexical item, which is usually viewed rather pejoratively as a mere filler, has resulted from a recent process of grammaticalization of the adjective pronto (`ready, quick'), with the meanings of `finished' or `complete' (in the case of a thing) or `prepared for' (for a person or thing). In this paper, we show how the different pragmatic-discoursal uses distinguished in the corpus (concluding, agreeing, explaining, imposing, punctuating, phatic, and emotive) are metonymically and metaphorically related to two initial mental images and their implications in different cognitive and communicative domains: the retrospective image of a finished process (concluding, agreeing, turn-yielding) and the prospective image of an available process (imposing, explaining, punctuating, turn-taking). We then go on to describe the process of grammaticalization. Finally, we identify the cognitive and pragmatic factors of the polysemy of the discourse markers and discuss the `invariant meaning' hypothesis put forward by Fischer (2000).

While most existing approaches are based on ray-tracing, we present an alternative approach by emulating multi-perspective rasterization on the classical perspective graphics pipeline. To render a general multi-perspective camera, we first decompose the camera into piecewise linear primitive cameras called the general linear cameras or GLCs. We derive the closed-form projection equations for GLCs and show how to rasterize triangles onto GLCs via a two-pass rendering algorithm. In the first pass, we compute the GLC projection coefficients of each scene triangle using a vertex shader. The linear raster on the graphics hardware then interpolates these coefficients at each pixel. Finally, we use these interpolated coefficients to compute the projected pixel coordinates using a fragment shader. In the second pass, we move the pixels to their actual projected positions. To avoid holes, we treat neighboring pixels as triangles and re-render them onto the GLC image plane. We demonstrate our real-time multi-perspective rendering framework in a wide range of applications including synthesizing panoramic and omnidirectional views, rendering reflections on curved mirrors, and creating multi-perspective faux animations. Compared with the GPU-based ray tracing methods, our rasterization approach scales better with scene complexity and it can render scenes with a large number of triangles at interactive frame rates.

Determining the polysemy is associated with the degree of belief. Thus, the degree of belief becomes the probability. The internal structure of the polysemy is the similarity and the nearness. To explain the polysemy, we derive the Gaussian probability density of two independent parameters by using the maximum entropy condition. The product of two probabilities shows the property of connected concepts. Thus, we can construct a prototype concept model from the standard deviation and a weighted-attribute model from the average of the probabilities. Finally, we will show simple examples of linguistic and scientific concepts by separating the concept space.				언어적 다의성은 한 단어로 연결할 수 있는 의미들을 나타낸다. 다의성은 연관된다는 믿음의 크기로 된다. 믿음의 정도를 수학적으로 구성하여 확률을 얻고, 다의성은 근접성과 유사성의 두 가지 특성을 가지므로, 최대 엔트로피 조건으로 2가지 독립변수를 갖는 가우스 확률 분포를 얻고, 다의성에 대응시킨다. 다의성 속성을 갖는 개념들을 결합하여 구성되는 결합 개념들을 두 개의 확률밀도의 곱이 만드는 특성을 이용하여 구분한다. 확률밀도의 평균값은 평균 개념을 만들며, 세부속성을 가중치로 합치는 세부특성모델로 되며, 모든 속성이 필요한 경우는 고전 범주 모델이 됨을 보인다. 또한 표준편차는 원형모델이 됨을 보인다. 개념 공간이 계열체와 통합체로 분류되고, 언어적 예와 과학적 예를 간단하게 보인다.					0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0374-4914															2015-04-16	KJD:ART001931975

Polysemy means there are words with more than one meaning or pronunciation, such as "(sic)"(no), "(sic)"(up), and "(sic)"(down), and so on. The correct pronunciation of a word affects the comprehensibility (or intelligibility) and fluency of Taiwanese speech. We applied our approach to solve the poly semy problems of the above mentioned three words. These words are difficult polysemy cases since they have many (6, 3, and 4, respectively) possible pronunciations. Results show that the proposed layered approach is over some language models and decision list classifier. Our approach has high accuracy and it can be extended when more training data is available.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1016-2364											Chien Kuo Technol Univ, Dept Informat Management, Changhua 500, TaiwanNatl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Taichung 402, Taiwan				2010-09-01	WOS:000282396700022

The performance of word-based models depends on the accuracy of word segmentation. Unfortunately, there are still errors in existing word segmentation tools (methods). Among the character-based models, Lattice LSTM-based models have been successful in CRE. However, such RNN-based models cannot meet the requirements of parallel computing and thus have natural drawbacks in model training and inference. There is much word polysemy in Chinese that constrains the performance of CRE. Most CRE models are built on English datasets, which often perform poorly on Chinese datasets. To address the above issues, we propose a method for CRE with the Polysemy Rethinking Mechanism. In this method, (1) we use a CNN-based architecture in which input is characters. It can incorporate word-level information through the lexicon to correct the error caused by word segmentation. (2) We propose a Polysemy Rethinking Mechanism, which can alleviate the problems caused by multiple meanings of one word by adding multiple sense information to the model. (3) Compared with the Lattice LSTM-based model, our model improves computational efficiency to gain results. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets of CRE. The results show that our method achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art ones.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0924-669X	1573-7497										Northeastern Univ, Software Coll, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R ChinaNortheastern Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R China				2022-08-05	WOS:000832835500006

The main steps of the procedure are: construct the attribute set; construct the evaluation object set; construct evaluation perspectives with corresponding attributes and weights: select evaluation algorithms for different perspectives: and carry out cluster analysis on the multidimensional evaluation results. This framework can effectively solve the problem of attribute overlapping of different perspectives and proper algorithms can be applied to different perspectives according to their characteristics. Based on the business data of a tobacco company, a customer evaluation system is designed according to this framework. Results show that the framework is effective and practical.

Matching names that refer to the same entities is an important issue in text analysis and a key component in many real world applications. Generally referred to as entity linking, it is defined as a task that aligns a name mentioned in free text to its corresponding entry in a Knowledge Base (KB). The difficulty of the task lies in the many-to-many correspondence between names and entities, causing the pseudonymity and polysemy issues. Existing work usually focuses on resolving polysemy by aggregating large numbers of loosely arranged features in supervised learning frameworks, with very few targeting the pseudonymity or both issues with the same depth. In this work, we tackle both issues by comprehensive modeling of an entity's name and context: we tackle the pseudonymity by modeling name variants on the query name and the KB title; and polysemy by modeling heterogeneous aspects of the query and KB context. Specially, we harness entity coreferences within query and KB documents together with the external alias resources for modeling name variants, and further use the name variants to identify focused context. Moreover, we propose a recall-boosted retrieval method for efficient candidate entity generation. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on the benchmark data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Their key element, a multi-perspective view (MPV), seamlessly combines what is seen from multiple viewpoints into a single image. This approach facilitates the presentation of information for virtual 3D city and landscape models, particularly by reducing occlusions, increasing screen-space utilization, and providing additional context within a single image. We complement MPVs with cartographic visualization techniques to stylize features according to their semantics and highlight important or prioritized information. When combined, both techniques constitute the core implementation of interactive, multi-perspective 3D panoramas. They offer a large number of effective means for visual communication of 3D spatial information, a high degree of customization with respect to cartographic design, and manifold applications in different domains. We discuss design decisions of 3D panoramas for the exploration of and navigation in 3D GeoVEs. We also discuss a preliminary user study that indicates that 3D panoramas are a promising approach for navigation systems using 3D GeoVEs.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1365-8816	1362-3087										Univ Potsdam, Hasso Plattner Inst, Potsdam, Brandenburg, Germany				2014-11-05	WOS:000342845000003

Our approach adopts a multi-baseline stereo strategy using a set of multi-perspective panoramas where large baseline lengths are available. We design two image acquisition rigs for capturing such multi-perspective panoramas. The first one is composed of two parallel stereo cameras. By rotating the rig about a vertical axis, we generate four multi-perspective panoramas by resampling the regular perspective images captured by the stereo cameras. Then a depth map is estimated from the four multi-perspective panoramas and an original perspective image using a multi-baseline matching technique with different types of epipolar constraints. The second one is composed of a single camera and two mirrors. By rotating the rig, we acquire a spatio-temporal volume that is made up of the sequential images captured by the camera. Then we estimate a depth map by extracting trajectories from the spatio-temporal volume by using a multi-baseline stereo technique by considering occlusions. We can consider both rotating rigs as a single rotating camera with a very large field of view (FOV), that offers a large baseline length in depth estimation. In addition, compared with a previous approach using two multi-perspective panoramas from a single rotating camera, our approach can reduce matching errors due to image noise, repeated patterns, and occlusions by multi-baseline stereo techniques. Experimental results using both synthetic and real images show that our approach produces high quality panoramic 3D reconstruction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0218-0014	1793-6381										Zhejiang Univ, Dept Control Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Ind Control Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaTokyo Inst Technol, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Meguro Ku, Tokyo 1528550, Japan				2010-09-01	WOS:000282216200002

Objective In this paper, we apply multi-perspective process mining techniques in the emergency process through a goal-driven performance evaluation method in order to understand and diagnose the timeliness of the emergency process. Methods Unstructured and multi-disciplinary emergency data is analyzed by following Goal-Question-Feature-Indicator (GQFI) method. In this paper, the GQFI method is extended with perspectives, and the insights in the enriched event data are examined by a decision tree model. All of them are applied in a systematic way in relation to the goal of assessing and improving the emergency process in a university hospital. Results We detected the deviations (e.g., skipping the triage and consultation request steps) and two bottlenecks in the emergency process. Among the suggestions for improving the process, are performing defensive medicine in a harmless manner, classification of the emergency services, ensuring triage step is applied to all patients and effective usage of the call system application in consultation activities. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that goal-oriented multi-perspective process mining is effective in identifying process improvements in emergency services.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1460-4582	1741-2811										Hacettepe Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Beytepe Campus, TR-06532 Ankara, Turkey				2022-03-15	WOS:000765302800001	35195463

Understanding surroundings is crucial for the ego-vehicle. This paper presents a Multi-perspective Tracking (MPT) framework for intelligent vehicle. An iterative search procedure is proposed to associate detections and tracklets in different perspectives. This procedure iteratively assigns determined states and estimates non-determined states for the detections and tracklets. An inherent determined and non-determined graph is utilized to reinforce this procedure. For more reliable associations between perspectives, a Siamese convolutional neural network is employed to learn feature representation. The supervised classification and verification signals are added to train the network. The features in different conventional stages are integrated together as the discriminative appearance model. The experiments are conducted on a MPT data set with five perspectives. The proposed framework is tested in each pair of adjacent perspectives for the ability to associate target objects between perspectives.									15	2	0	0	0	0	18			1524-9050	1558-0016										Tsinghua Univ, Dept Automat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R ChinaNorthwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Elect & Informat, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaHarvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA				2018-12-28	WOS:000424060200018

The approach then is used to cast doubt on an often-cited plurality vote property.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0364-765X											Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92717 USAUniv Calif Irvine, Dept Math, Irvine, CA 92717 USA				2002-02-01	WOS:000174559400003

Unbalanced homonymous ("pen"), balanced homonymous ("panel"), metaphorically polysemous ("lip"), and metonymically polysemous words ("rabbit") were used in a visual single-word priming delayed lexical decision task. The theoretical distinction between homonymy and polysemy was reflected in the N400 component. Homonymous words (balanced and unbalanced) showed effects of dominance/frequency with reduced N400 effects predominantly observed for dominant meanings. Polysemous words (metaphors and metonymies) showed effects of core meaning representation with both dominant and subordinate meanings showing reduced N400 effects. Furthermore, the division within polysemy, into metaphor and metonymy, was supported. Differences emerged in meaning activation patterns with the subordinate meanings of metaphor inducing differentially reduced N400 effects moving from left hemisphere electrode sites to right hemisphere electrode sites, potentially suggesting increased involvement of the right hemisphere in the processing of figurative meaning.

Thus, we propose to construct multi-perspective investor attention index based on Google Trends considering these four perspectives besides the common perspective of crude oil, so as to augment oil price volatility prediction. Our empirical results show that, investor attention to different perspectives contributes differently to oil price volatility over different forecast horizons, and the model incorporating multi-perspective investor attention significantly out-performs the benchmark volatility forecasting model and the model incorporating only investor attention to crude oil. Moreover, considering heterogeneity and asymmetry of multi-perspective investor attention further contributes to oil price volatility prediction, and combing various attention-augmented models with the dynamic model selection approach leads to forecasts with stable and significant superiority.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0140-9883	1873-6181										Nanjing Univ, Sch Management & Engn, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Peoples R China				2023-03-27	WOS:000948387100001

Much research works have been done on automatic fake news detection in single domain. However, fake news exists in various domains, so the detection model based on single domain is less effective in multiple domain scenes. To improve the detection ability of multi-domain fake news, we propose a perspective collaboration for multi-domain fake news detection (PCMFND) method to detect fake news across multiple domains by combining the powerful feature extraction ability of expert systems. The method extracts features of different perspectives from news content separately, then interactively combines the features of different perspectives, and ultimately achieves fake news detection by adaptively aggregating features of each perspective through domain knowledge. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comparison experiments with traditional multi-domain detection methods on Chinese and English multi-domain datasets.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0218-0014	1793-6381										Jiangsu Ocean Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Lianyungang 222000, Jinagsu, Peoples R ChinaNingxia Med Univ, Gen Hosp, Dept Neurol, Yinchuan 750004, Ningxia, Peoples R China				2024-04-02	WOS:001192201500001

A point p epsilon R-d is a plurality point for V when the following holds: for every q epsilon R-d, the number of voters closer to p than to q is at least the number of voters closer to q than to p. Thus, in a vote where each v epsilon V votes for the nearest proposal (and voters for which the proposals are at equal distance abstain), proposal p will not lose against any alternative proposal q. For most voter sets, a plurality point does not exist. We therefore introduce the concept of beta-plurality points, which are defined similarly to regular plurality points, except that the distance of each voter to p (but not to q) is scaled by a factor beta, for some constant 0 < beta <= 1. We investigate the existence and computation of beta-plurality points and obtain the following results.Define beta(d)* := sup{beta : any finite multiset V in R-d admits a beta-plurality point). We prove that beta*(2) = root 3/2, and that 1/root d <= beta(d)* <= root 3/2 for all d >= 3.Define beta(p, V) := sup{beta : p is a beta-plurality point for V). Given a voter set V in R-2, we provide an algorithm that runs in O(n log n) time and computes a point p such that beta(p, V) >= beta*(2). Moreover, for d >= 2, we can compute a point p with beta(p, V) >= 1/root d in O(n) time.Define beta(V) := sup{beta : V admits a beta-plurality point). We present an algoritlun that, given a voter set V in R-d computes an ((1 - epsilon) .beta(V))-plurality point in time O(n(2)/epsilon(3d-2) center dot log n/epsilon(d-1) center dot log(2)1/epsilon.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1549-6325	1549-6333										NYU, Tandon Sch Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 370 Jay St, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USATU Eindhoven, Dept Comp Sci, Eindhoven, NetherlandsUniv Sydney, Sch Comp Sci, Bldg J12,1 Cleveland St, Darlington, NSW 2008, AustraliaDept Math & Comp Sci, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands	Dept Math & Comp Sci			2021-08-20	WOS:000683004100007		
J									Ana Lucia de Paula Muller		Plurality and distributivity across human languages: the case of Karitiana																												Awarded Grant	Oct 01 2011	2011	This project focuses on the expression of plurality and distributivity across human languages under the paradigm of theoretical linguistics, within the framework of formal semantics. The theoretical problem to be tackled is the relation between plurality and ditributivity within natural languages. More specifically, we face the question of whether distributivity is a mere consequence of plurality or if plurality and distributivity are distinct phenomena and imply distinct semantic operations. The project will investigate this question in Karitiana, a native Brazilian language of the Tupi family. The empirical goal of the project is the description of the semantics of plurality and distributivity in Karitiana.

However, deformable transformer only explores local-perspective perception by attending to a small set of key sampling points, which will make the decoder short-sighted and generate semantically incoherent and contradictory dense captions for a long video. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Perspective Perception Network to improve this problem. We first introduce a hierarchical temporal-spatial summary method to generate global-perspective summary context for each decoder layer and avoid redundant information. Then our new designed multiperspective attention encourages the model to selectively incorporate the multi-perspective perception feature. Finally, we propose a novel multi-perspective generator to perform both multi-perspective feature fusion and caption generation. Experiments show that our proposed model outperforms previously published methods and achieves a competitive performance on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2. The design of our model also shows the universality of other visual tasks that we obtain comparable results by applying our model for Object Detection and Paragraph Video Captioning.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0925-2312	1872-8286										Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin, Peoples R ChinaJD AI Res, Beijing, Peoples R China	JD AI Res			2023-09-10	WOS:001047932900001

Then, they can be consolidated into a single image using perspective transforms. In contrast to that, we propose a novel non-linear warping scheme which allows the merging of multi-perspective images, thus taking advantage of scattered cameras. Therefore, a polygonal cut is defined in two source images to be merged, Usually, the layout of the cuts does not allow a user to stitch both images together naively. Thus, two convex combinations of a warped and a canonic coordinate system are applied so that both source images fit together at the cutting edge while the inevitable distortion decreases towards the borders of the image to obtain a natural appearance.

Recently, graph convolutional network has been proved to be an effective way to explore the labels dependencies. However, due to the complexity of label semantic relations, the static dependencies obtained by existing methods cannot consider the overall characteristics of an image and accurately locate the target region. Therefore, we propose the Multi-layered Multi-perspective Dynamic Semantic Representation (MMDSR) for multi-label image classification, which mainly includes three important modules: (1) multi-scale feature reconstruction, which aggregates complementary information at different levels in convolutional neural network through cross-layer attention, it can effectively identify target categories of different sizes; (2) channel dual-branch cross-attention module, we propose to explore the correlation between global information and local features in multi-scale features by the way of adaptive cross-fusion to locate the target area more accurately; (3) dynamic semantic representation module, we design the multi-perspective weighted cosine measure to construct content-based label dependencies for each image to dynamically construct a semantic relationship graph. Extensive experiments on the two datasets MS-COCO and VOC2007 have verified that the classification performance of our proposed MMDSR is better than many state-of-the-art methods.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0885-6125	1573-0565										Guangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Educ Blockchain & Intelligent Technol, Minist Educ, Guilin 541004, Guangxi, Peoples R ChinaGuangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Multisource Informat Min & Secur, Guilin 541004, Guangxi, Peoples R China				2024-01-01	WOS:001126995600002

This is challenging because it requires understanding a video, a sentence, and the relationship between them. Existing TML methods have shown impressive performances by modeling interactions between videos and sentences using fine-grained techniques. However, these fine-grained techniques require a high computational overhead, making them impractical. This work proposes an effective and efficient multi-perspective attention network for temporal moment localization. Inspired by the way humans understand an image from multiple perspectives and different contexts, we devise a novel multi-perspective attention mechanism consisting of perspective attention and multi-perspective modal interactions. Specifically, a perspective attention layer based on multi-head attention takes two memory sequences, one as the base and the other as the reference memory, as inputs. Perspective attention assesses the two different memories, models the relationship, and encourages the base memory to focus on features related to the reference memory, providing an understanding of the base memory from the perspective of the reference memory. Furthermore, multi-perspective modal interactions model the complex relationship between a video and sentence query, and obtain the modal-interacted memory, consisting of a visual feature that selectively learned query-related information. Similar to the heavyweight fine-grained TML methods, the proposed network obtains the accurate complex relationship while being lightweight like coarse-grained TML methods. We also adopt a fast action recognition network to efficiently extract visual features, which reduce the computational overhead. Through experiments on three TML benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed network.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536											Univ Sci & Technol, Dept ICT, Daejeon 34113, South KoreaElect & Telecommun Res Inst, Daejeon 34129, South Korea				2021-09-06	WOS:000690430600001

A point p is called a plurality point if it is preferred by at least as many voters as any other point p'.We present an algorithm that decides in O(n log n) time whether V admits a plurality point in the L-2 norm and, if so, finds the (unique) plurality point. We also give efficient algorithms to compute a minimum-cost subset W subset of V such that V \ W admits a plurality point, and to compute a so-called minimum-radius plurality ball.Finally, we consider the problem in the personalized L-1 norm, where each point nu is an element of V has a preference vector (w(1) (nu), . . . ,w(d)(nu)> and the distance from v to any point p is an element of R-d is given by Sigma(d)(i=1) w(i) (nu) . vertical bar x(i) (nu) - x(i) (p) vertical bar. For this case we can compute in O(n(d-1)) time the set of all plurality points of V. When all preference vectors are equal, the running time improves to O(n).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1549-6325	1549-6333										TU Eindhoven, Dept Comp Sci, Eindhoven, NetherlandsUniv Sydney, Sch IT, Sydney, NSW, Australia				2018-08-02	WOS:000439626200011

It draws on the semantic primes of the natural semantic metalanguage, the theoretical constructs of semantic space, and force dynamics as well as semantic maps based on graph theory. In the semantic map, graphs link poles to definiens and lexical nodes, in such a way that the centrality of the poles is indicated, quantitatively, by the number of edges and, qualitatively, by the distance between the pole that exerts the centrifugal force and the pole to which such a force is directed. The conclusion is reached that the semantic poles MOVE, BE, and SAY constitute the core of the verbal lexicon of Old English, considering the semantic space that they occupy and the centrifugal and centripetal forces that produce polysemy originating in these semantic poles.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2055-7671	2055-768X										Univ La Rioja, Logrono, Spain				2018-05-11	WOS:000431078900009

Awarded Grant	Jan 01 1800	1995	The aim of our research was to recognize the prevalence of the duality of "Universality" and "Plurality" in every aspect of human language, thought, and culture, to cnsider the extent of possible relationships between these two elements, and to draw from this consideration some philosphically signficant morals concerning human mental activity in general. The duality of universality and plurality was to be considered with regard to the congnitive and evaluative modes of mental activity, and it was to be considered from historical and logical viewpoints. Thus, our research was constructed on the triangular combination of dualities, i.e., universality and plurality, congnition and evaluation, and historical and logical analyzes. Such a combination was expected to bring a much comprehensive picture of human mentality in relief. The first year of research was spent for a joint preliminary study of precedent researches in this field. The tentative conclusions drawn from this preliminary study were : (1) One of the most essential foci of meta-theoretical reflections on philisophy and religion through the history of western philosophy was indeed the problem of universality and plurality. (2) The crucial touchstone of contemporary analytic philosophy of language and congnition also lies in its treatment of the problem of universality and plurality, or individual particularity. The second and third years of our research were spent for the individual studies by research members to give substances to these hypothetical theses. The result was a variety of interpretative analyzes of Pre-Socratic thinkers, Aristotle, Bonavebtura, Thomas Aquinas, Nicolaus Cusanus, Kant, Brentano, Keynes, Dummett, and others. This result is published in the form of an anthology of research papers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						07401001								KYOTO UNIVERSITY				2023-12-08	GRANTS:14731244

However, KGs still have many incomplete facts, so Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is proposed to infer missing facts. Among them, Graph Attention Network-based models (GATs) show great power. However, GATs have two flaws in handling multiple semantics of entities in relational context: (1) Current GATs fail to distinguish the various semantics of the entity which are exhibited by the relations from different perspectives. (2) Existing GATs cannot capture the similar semantics of different entities which are presented by the relations from the same perspective. Hence, we propose a graph attention network based on multi-perspective semantic decoupling and enhancement (MSDE). To capture diverse semantics in the relational context, we classify relations to partition entity multi-perspective semantics, and then we use graph attention networks to obtain multi-perspective decoupled embeddings of entities. To capture semantically similar entities, we select multi-perspective similar entities based on multi-perspective conditional entropy and high-order similar neighbors based on multi-perspective decoupled embedding. Finally, we use an attention decay network to aggregate multi-perspective similar entities and high-order similar neighbors to update entity feature embeddings. Experimental results show that MSDE exhibits marked performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art (sota) models. Significantly, the MRR indicator improves by 6.5% on the FB15K-237 dataset, by 2.3% on the WN18RR dataset, by 7.3% on the Kinship dataset and by 9.2% on the YAGO3-10 over the sota models.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-669X	1573-7497										Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Yaguan Rd,Haihe Educ Pk, Tianjin 300354, Peoples R China				2025-04-10	WOS:001459686100003

However, as commonly seen in art, scenes and objects can be visualized from multiple perspectives. Making such images manually is time consuming and tedious. We propose a novel system for designing multi-perspective images and videos. First, the images in the input sequence are aligned using structure from motion. This enables us to track feature points across the sequence. Second, the user chooses portal polygons in a target image into which different perspectives are to be embedded. The corresponding image regions from the other images are then copied into these portals. Due to the tracking feature and automatic warping, this approach is considerably faster than current tools. We explore a wide range of artistic applications using our system with image and video data, such as looking around corners and up and down stair cases, recursive multi-perspective imaging, cubism and panoramas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0167-7055	1467-8659										UCL, London WC1E 6BT, EnglandUniv Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England				2012-07-04	WOS:000304901400008

Multi-spectral and multi-perspective video arrays for driver body tracking and activity analysis								COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING				106	2-3			245	257				10.1016/j.cviu.2006.08.010							Article	MAY-JUN 2007	2007	This paper presents a novel approach to recognizing driver activities using a multi-perspective (i.e., four camera views) multi-modal (i.e., thermal infrared and color) video-based system for robust and real-time tracking of important body parts. The multi-perspective characteristics of the system provides redundant trajectories of the body parts, while the multi-modal characteristics of the system provides robustness and reliability of feature detection and tracking. The combination of a deterministic activity grammar (called 'operation-triplet') and a Hidden Markov model-based classifier provides semantic-level analysis of human activity. The application context for this research is that of intelligent vehicles and driver assistance systems. Experimental results in real-world street driving demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed system. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

These shortcomings can bias decisions and hinder public acceptance for planning supported by LCA. This paper introduces a method for interpreting LCA results, the Argumentation Corrected Context Weighting-LCA (ArgCW-LCA), to overcome these barriers. ArgCW-LCA incorporates stakeholder preferences, corrects unjustified disagreements, and allows for the inclusion of non-environmental impacts (e.g., economic, social, etc.) using a novel weighting scheme and the application of multi-criteria decision analysis to provide transparent and context-relevant decision support. We illustrate the utility of the method through two case studies: a hypothetical decision regarding energy production and a real-world decision regarding polyphenol extraction technologies. In each case, we surveyed a relevant stakeholder group on their environmental views and fed their responses into the model to provide decision support that is relevant to their perspective. We found marked differences between results using ArgCW-LCA and results from a conventional analysis using an equal-weighting scheme, as well as differentiation between stakeholder preference groups, indicating the importance of applying the perspective of the particular stakeholder group. For instance, there was a rank reversal of alternatives when comparing between an equal weighting approach for all environmental and economic dimensions and ArgCW-LCA. ArgCW-LCA provides opportunity for both public and private sector incorporation of LCA, such as in developing enlightened stakeholder value measures. This is achieved through enabling the LCA practition to provide public and private actors' interpreted LCA results in a manner that incorporates educated stakeholder perspectives. Furthermore, the method encourages stakeholder multiplicity through participatory design and policymaking that can enhance public backing of actions that can make society more sustainable.									9	0	0	0	0	0	10				2071-1050										Tech Univ Denmark, Sustainabil Div, DTU Management, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkUniv Montpellier, INRIA GraphIK, IATE, INRAE, F-34060 Montpellier, FranceIndian Inst Technol, CUSE, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, IndiaIndian Inst Technol, Associate Fac, Interdisciplinary Programme Climate Studies, Mumbai 400076, Maharashtra, IndiaUniv Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USAUniv Southern Denmark, Dept Chem Engn Biotechnol & Environm Technol, SDU Life Cycle Engn, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark				2020-03-02	WOS:000523751400017

However, the target attitude obtained by the existing 3D reconstruction methods is unknown. In addition, using a single perspective, one can only get 3D reconstruction result of a simple target. For a complex target, due to occlusion and scattering characteristics, 3D reconstruction information obtained from a single perspective is limited. To tackle the above two problems, this paper proposes a new method for multi-perspective 3D reconstruction and single perspective instantaneous target attitude estimation. This method consists of three steps. First, the result of 3D reconstruction with unknown attitude is obtained by the traditional matrix factorization method. Then, in order to obtain the attitude of a target 3D reconstruction, additional constraints are added to the projection vectors which are computed from the matrix factorization method. Finally, the information from different perspectives are merged into a single layer information according to certain rules. After the information fusion, a multi-perspective 3D reconstruction structure with better visibility and more information is obtained. Simulation results have proved the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.									10	0	0	0	1	0	12				2072-4292										Xidian Univ, Natl Lab Radar Signal Proc, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaXidian Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Informat Sensing & Underst, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaShenzhen Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R ChinaUniv Delaware, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Newark, DE 19716 USA				2019-07-09	WOS:000472648000020

Then, in every round, each agent can revise his color according to the colors currently held by a random sample of his neighbors. It is assumed that the initial color configuration exhibits a sufficiently large bias s towards a fixed plurality color, that is, the number of nodes supporting the plurality color exceeds the number of nodes supporting any other color by s additional nodes. The goal is having the process to converge to the stable configuration in which all nodes support the initial plurality. We consider a basic model in which the network is a clique and the update rule (called here the 3-majority dynamics) of the process is the following: each agent looks at the colors of three random neighbors and then applies the majority rule (breaking ties uniformly). We prove that the process converges in time O(min{k, (n/log n)(1/3)} log n) with high probability, provided that s >= c root min{2k, (n/log n)(1/3)} n log n. We then prove that our upper bound above is tight as long as k <= (n/log n)(1/4). This fact implies an exponential time-gap between the plurality-consensus process and the median process (see Doerr et al. in Proceedings of the 23rd annual ACM symposium on parallelism in algorithms and architectures (SPAA' 11), pp 149-158. ACM, 2011). A natural question is whether looking at more (than three) random neighbors can significantly speed up the process. We provide a negative answer to this question: in particular, we show that samples of polylogarithmic size can speed up the process by a polylogarithmic factor only.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0178-2770	1432-0452										Sapienza Univ Roma, Rome, ItalyMax Planck Inst Informat, Saarbrucken, GermanyUniv Tor Vergata Roma, Rome, ItalyUniv Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA USA				2017-09-22	WOS:000410056600004

However, news inherently encompasses multiple perspectives, including internal elements such as semantics, emotion, and style, as well as the news environment which may offer valuable information for news censorship. Combining multiple perspectives helps mitigate the biases and provides comprehensive information for news censorship. Thus, we propose the Cross-Attention Multi-Perspective Fusion Network Based Fake News Censorship (MPFNC). In this model, we design an Internal Multi-Perspective Fusion Network to integrate the internal perspectives of news, including semantic, emotion, and style, and equip it with Cross-Attention to capture the correlations between these perspectives. Additionally, we construct the news environment based on the fuzzy cluster and apply Cross-Attention to uncover associations with the internal perspectives. Compared to the current SOTA models, our model achieves a 3.04% and 3.86% improvement in F1 score on Chinese and English datasets, respectively. On fake news datasets generated by LLMs, our model also outperforms the best-performing LLM by 10% in accuracy.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0925-2312	1872-8286										China Univ Petr, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R ChinaShandong Data Open Innovat Applicat Lab, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr, Innovat Lab Federated Data Intelligence, 66 Changjiang West Rd, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R China	Shandong Data Open Innovat Applicat Lab			2024-10-23	WOS:001334380200001

However, there is little theoretical analysis of plurality voting. In this paper, we attempt to explore the rationale behind plurality voting. The recognition/error/rejection rates of plurality voting are compared with those of majority voting under different conditions. It is demonstrated that plurality voting is more efficient in achieving the tradeoff between rejection rate and error rate. We also discuss some practical problems when applying plurality voting to real-world applications.

Despite existing GNN-based RUL prediction methods have achieved promising results, they do not consider the spatial-temporal dependencies of multi-sensor data from different perspectives (global and local), making it difficult to fully utilize the useful information in multi-sensor data. Secondly, traditional point prediction method can only provide the possible future RUL prediction value, but cannot quantify the uncertainty of RUL prediction, making it difficult to provide more information for decision-making. To address the above challenges, we propose a multi-perspective spatial-temporal graph attention network (MST-GAT) for multi-sensor equipment RUL prediction. MST-GAT constructs a multi-perspective graph attention network (MP-GAT) and a temporal convolutional network (TCN) to capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies in multi-sensor data. Specifically, MPGAT employs a multi-head self-attention mechanism and two multi-head explicit sparse self-attention mechanisms to explicitly model global and local spatial dependencies, and feeds multi-perspective spatial information into TCN to capture temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a joint optimization network is constructed for predicting RUL and its prediction interval to quantify uncertainty. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MST-GAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in RUL prediction and can accurately quantify uncertainty.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1566-2535	1872-6305										Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Civil Aviat, Nanjing 211106, Peoples R China				2024-07-16	WOS:001265772900001

Existing KGs contain only a fraction of what is really happening in the real life. Knowledge graph completion (KGC) has attracted attention because it can automatically infer and predict missing links in the KGs. The classical geometric, tensor decomposition and convolutional neural network (CNN) based models generate expressive feature embeddings, but these models treat triples independently and thus fail to cover the hidden information that is inherently implicit in the local neighborhood surrounding a triple. Recent works have introduced Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) into KGC task for leveraging the rich structural information in complex graphs. However, existing GCN-based models have limitations in relational topology distinction and multi-perspective feature aggregation. As multi-relational graphs, KGs display intrinsic heterogeneous structures and rich entity types. Therefore, ignoring the rich structural information and perspective features will greatly limit the expressive power of these models. In this paper, we propose multi-relational GCNs for modeling topological correlation and multi-perspective independence (CorIn). Specifically, we propose a multi-integration ring relational topology to fine-grained select neighbors according to relational correlation patterns, and capture the independence of multi-perspective feature groups by mutual information minimization. Our model adaptively utilizes an embedding learning design that can leverage a variety of entity-relation composition operations from classical KGC models. We evaluate our model on the public benchmark datasets and achieve marked performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, the diversity of social relationships, which is instructive to the propagation of social influence, has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional network based representation learning method, namely multi-perspective social recommendation (MPSR), to construct hierarchical user preferences and assign friends' influences with different levels of trust from varying perspectives. We further utilize the attributes of items to partition and excavate users' explicit preferences and employ complementary perspective modeling to learn implicit preferences of users. To measure the trust degree of friends from different perspectives, the statistical information of users' historical behavior is utilized to construct multi-perspective social networks. Experimental results on two public datasets of Yelp and Ciao demonstrate that the MPSR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Further detailed analysis verifies the importance of mining explicit characteristics of users and the necessity for diverse social relationships, which show the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model.

Depending on the context, it may be much more natural to represent the list succinctly, as the distinct votes of the electorate and their counts, i.e., high-multiplicity representation. We consider how this representation affects the complexity of election problems. High-multiplicity representation may be exponentially smaller than standard representation, and so many polynomial-time algorithms for election problems in standard representation become exponential-time. Surprisingly, for polynomial-time election problems, we are often able to either adapt the same approach or provide new algorithms to show that these problems remain polynomial-time in the high-multiplicity case; this is in sharp contrast to the case where each voter has a weight, where the complexity usually increases. In the process we explore the relationship between high-multiplicity scheduling and manipulation of high-multiplicity elections. And we show that for any fixed set of job lengths, high-multiplicity scheduling on uniform parallel machines is in P, which was previously known for only two job lengths. We did not find any natural case where a polynomial-time election problem does not remain in P when moving to high-multiplicity representation. However, we found one natural NP-hard election problem where the complexity does increase, namely winner determination for Kemeny elections.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1387-2532	1573-7454										Coll Holy Cross, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Worcester, MA 01610 USARochester Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Rochester, NY 14623 USA				2019-06-28	WOS:000471715500001

Effective sensitive video recognition is necessary for web content security. Among web sensitive videos, this paper focuses on violent and horror videos. Based on color emotion and color harmony theories, we extract visual emotional features from videos. A video is viewed as a bag and each shot in the video is represented by a key frame which is treated as an instance in the bag. Then, we combine multi-instance learning (MIL) with sparse coding to recognize violent and horror videos. The resulting MIL-based model can be updated online to adapt to changing web environments. We propose a cost-sensitive context-aware multi-instance sparse coding (MI-SC) method, in which the contextual structure of the key frames is modeled using a graph, and fusion between audio and visual features is carried out by extending the classic sparse coding into cost-sensitive sparse coding. We then propose a multi-perspective multi-instance joint sparse coding (MI-J-SC) method that handles each bag of instances from an independent perspective, a contextual perspective, and a holistic perspective. The experiments demonstrate that the features with an emotional meaning are effective for violent and horror video recognition, and our cost-sensitive context-aware MI-SC and multi-perspective MI-J-SC methods outperform the traditional MIL methods and the traditional SVM and KNN-based methods.									16	1	0	0	0	0	18			1520-9210	1941-0077										Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, NLPR, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaShandong Inst Business & Technol, Yantai 264005, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Jiaotong Uni, Sch Software Engn, Beijing 100044, Peoples R ChinaBirkbeck Coll, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, London WC1E 7HX, England	Beijing Jiaotong Uni			2016-01-13	WOS:000367139700008

The support given through a PAIS is greatly enhanced when it is able to provide accurate time predictions which is typically a very challenging task. Predictions should be (1) multi-dimensional and (2) not based on a single process instance. Furthermore, the prediction system should be able to (3) adapt to changing circumstances and (4) deal with multi-perspective declarative languages (e.g., models which consider time, resource, data and control flow perspectives). In this work, a novel approach for generating time predictions considering the aforementioned characteristics is proposed. For this, first, a multi-perspective constraint-based language is used to model the scenario. Thereafter, an optimized enactment plan (representing a potential execution alternative) is generated from such a model considering the current execution state of the process instances. Finally, predictions are performed by evaluating a desired function over this enactment plan. To evaluate the applicability of our approach in practical settings we apply it to a real process scenario. Despite the high complexity of the considered problems, results indicate that our approach produces a satisfactory number of good predictions in a reasonable time.									7	3	0	0	0	0	9			0219-1377	0219-3116										Univ Seville, Dept Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, Seville, SpainUniv Granada, Dept Ciencias Comp & Inteligencia Artificial, Granada, SpainTech Univ Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark				2018-12-28	WOS:000443972500006

Today's engineers, however, are limited in the number of candidates that they are able to evaluate in order to find the optimal architectures. This limitation results from the difficulty in defining the candidates as it is a mostly manual process. In this work, we propose a way to synthesize multi-level, multi-perspective candidate architectures and to explore them across the different layers and perspectives. Using a reference model similar to the EAST-ADL domain model but with a focus on early design, we explore the candidate architectures for two case studies: an automotive power window system and the central door locking system. Further, we provide a comprehensive set of question templates, based on the different layers and perspectives, that engineers can ask to synthesize only the candidates relevant to their task at hand. Finally, using the modeling language Clafer, which is supported by automated backend reasoners, we show that it is possible to synthesize and explore optimal candidate architectures for two highly configurable automotive sub-systems.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1619-1366	1619-1374										Univ Waterloo, Elect & Comp Engn Dept, Waterloo, ON, CanadaUniv Waterloo, Elect & Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON, CanadaUniv Waterloo, David R Cheriton Sch Comp Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada				2019-03-15	WOS:000459934300029

Nonetheless, the stock's considerable complexity renders accurate prediction of stock trends more challenging. This paper proposes a novel multi-perspective approach that converts the time series prediction challenge into an image classification problem, referred to as the Multi-perspective Denoise Transformer (MPDTransformer). We initially multi-factor features into two-dimensional images employing a multi-perspective approach to more comprehensively explain the actual market conditions and enhance the model's practicality and adaptability; secondly, we utilize a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) to extract features, which effectively eliminates noise and enhances data purity; finally, to comprehensively capture the temporal relationships within the data and gain a deeper understanding of the overall time series, we employ a Transformer for prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other prevalent stock trend prediction techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1875-6891	1875-6883										Shandong Technol & Business Univ, Sch Math & Informat Sci, Yantai 264005, Peoples R ChinaShandong Technol & Business Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Yantai 264005, Peoples R ChinaYantai Key Lab Big Data Modeling & Intelligent Com, Yantai 264005, Peoples R ChinaImmers Technol & Evaluat Shandong Engn Res Ctr, Yantai 264005, Peoples R China	Yantai Key Lab Big Data Modeling & Intelligent ComImmers Technol & Evaluat Shandong Engn Res Ctr			2025-03-05	WOS:001434416000002

Suppose we are given n balls colored with three colors. At any step of the game, Paul chooses two balls and asks whether they are of the same color, whereupon Carol answers yes or no. The game ends when Paul either produces a ball a of the plurality color (meaning that the number of balls colored like a exceeds those of the other colors), or when Paul states that there is no plurality. How many questions L(n) does Paul have to ask in the worst case? We show that 3[n/2] - 2 less than or equal to L(n) less than or equal to [5n/3] - 2.					21st Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science21st Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science	APR, 2004APR, 2004		Montpellier, FRANCEMontpellier, FRANCE	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0302-9743		3-540-21236-1									Free Univ Berlin, Inst Math 2, D-14195 Berlin, GermanyCNR, Ist Informat & Telemat, I-56124 Pisa, Italy				2004-01-01	WOS:000189497100045

This goal can be accomplished using the Clinical Scenario Evaluation approach. This approach encourages trial sponsors to perform comprehensive assessments of applicable analysis strategies such as multiplicity adjustments under all plausible sets of statistical assumptions using relevant evaluation criteria. This two-part paper applies a novel class of criteria, known as criteria based on multiplicity penalties, to the problem of evaluating the performance of several candidate multiplicity adjustments. The ultimate goal of this evaluation is to identify efficient and robust adjustments for each individual trial and optimally select parameters of these adjustments. Part I deals with traditional problems with a single source of multiplicity. Two case studies based on recently conducted Phase III trials are used to illustrate penalty-based approaches to evaluating candidate multiple testing methods and constructing optimization algorithms.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1054-3406	1520-5711										Inst Rech Int Servier, Dept Oncol Biostat, Suresnes, FranceMediana Inc, Overland Pk, KS USA	Mediana Inc			2018-02-13	WOS:000423632600011	29172961

Traditional KQGA methods are usually limited to single-hop queries and cannot handle complex questions involving multi-hop reasoning well. To overcome this issue, multi-hop KGQA based on reinforcement learning (RL) has been proposed. However, multi-hop KGQA based on RL still faces some challenges. Firstly, due to the insufficient availability of latent environmental information during the reasoning process, the agent finds it challenging to make coherent and correct decisions. Secondly, the agent only receives rewards from the environment upon reaching the answer entity during the exploration, leading to slow or even obstructed learning. To address these shortcomings, we construct multi-perspective information based on the state of the environment, and integrate multi-perspective information with RL framework, thereby creating the Multi-Perspective Information Fusion Reasoning Network (MPIFRN). MPIFRN achieves the goal via three steps. (1) We construct three different views of information, i.e., expectation embedding, instructionguided embedding, and path-aware embedding. These environmental cues provide more reliable support for decision-making. (2) We still adopt the method of mapping entities and relations into the knowledge graph embedding space to answer multi-hop questions. At each step of reasoning, we use a scoring function to measure the plausibility of each "triple" in the embedding space. (3) Furthermore, we employ the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm to guide the agent in selecting the most promising entities and to expand the reasoning paths in parallel by updating policy and value network parameters, thereby facilitating multi-hop knowledge graph question answering. We conduct extensive experiments on KGQA benchmark datasets, providing substantial evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0957-4174	1873-6793										Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaiFlytek Res, Shanghai, Peoples R China	iFlytek Res			2024-07-26	WOS:001272867900001

This architecture is based on machine learning and on cognitive psychology studies in concept formation. Our basic assumption is that concept formation should be considered as a goal-driven, context-dependent process and, therefore, that the hierarchical organization of concepts should be represented in different perspectives. The core of our architecture is a learning system that generates multi-perspective hierarchies. The evaluation of the architecture is realized from a perspective of both the comprehensibility and the prediction power of the generated knowledge.					9th European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop on Advances in Knowledge Acquisition (EKAW 96)9th European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop on Advances in Knowledge Acquisition (EKAW 96)	MAY 14-17, 1996MAY 14-17, 1996	MLNet; European Network Excellence Machine Learning; Univ Nottingham, Dept Psychol Artificial Intelligence Grp; Brit Comp Soc, Specialist Grp Expert SystMLNet; European Network Excellence Machine Learning; Univ Nottingham, Dept Psychol Artificial Intelligence Grp; Brit Comp Soc, Specialist Grp Expert Syst	NOTTINGHAM, ENGLANDNOTTINGHAM, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		3-540-61273-4													1996-01-01	WOS:A1996BH80K00015

'Media multiplicities' are defined here as creative media experiences made up of multiples of interacting and coordinated devices. In this paper, we review the state of the art of multiplicitous media artworks and provide a systematic analysis of the novel affordances and different forms such artworks can take, specifically that they are spatial, scalable, scatterable and sensing. We consider the analysis of media multiplicities from the point of view of both user experience and creative production. We offer three primary axes through which a categorisation of multiplicitous media forms can be framed: substrate versus object; composed versus self-organised, and homogeneous versus heterogeneous. We also analyse how the number of elements in the multiplicities (from tens to tens of thousands and beyond) affects the qualities of the experience.									13	0	0	0	0	0	14			1875-9521	1875-953X										UNSW Art & Design, Paddington Campus,Oxford St, Paddington, NSW, AustraliaFac Engn & IT, Creat & Cognit Studios, Sydney, NSW, Australia	UNSW Art & DesignFac Engn & IT			2018-03-08	WOS:000425850100006

However, it also leads to checkerboard artifacts and the unpleasing high-frequency (HF) components. In this paper, we propose a multi-discriminators-based image super resolution method that distinguishes those artifacts from various perspectives. First, the DCT perspective discriminator is proposed because the checkerboard artifacts are easily separated on the frequency domain. Second, the gradient perspective discriminator is proposed, because the unpleasing HF components can be discriminated on the gradient magnitude distribution. These proposed multi-perspective discriminators can easily identify artifacts, and they can help the generator reproduce artifact-less SR images. The experimental results show that the proposed SR-GAN with multi-perspective discriminators achieves objective and subjective quality improvements in terms of PSNR, SSIM, PI and MOS, as compared to the conventional SR-GAN by reducing the aforementioned artifacts.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			2169-3536											Korea Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea				2020-08-28	WOS:000560162000001

Among the subspace clustering methods, spectral-based techniques have become increasingly popular in the last decade due to their potential to handle corrupt samples through the self-expressiveness property of data. It is, therefore, crucial to compare the spectral-based methods with each other. However, previous studies often analyze them from a single perspective, which does not tell the whole story. This paper presents an analysis of existing spectral-based methods from two perspectives: single-view and multi-view. Firstly, a detailed fundamental of subspace clustering is presented. Afterward, an overview of available techniques is provided from the two perspectives. Furthermore, we evaluate the clustering performances of current techniques on four datasets: UCI-Digits, Yale, COIL20 and Caltech101-07. In each paradigm, we first compare some existing approaches against each other and then investigate the improvement of the multi-view approaches over the single-view methods. From the results of different experiments, it was evident that not all multi-view methods outperform their single-view counterparts consistently. Surprisingly, in certain datasets, some single-view methods even outperformed some multi-view methods. To strengthen this comparison, we compare the similarity matrices of the different techniques. Finally, we highlight the challenges and recommend future research.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1380-7501	1573-7721										Jiangsu Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Commun Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv Nigeria, Dept Comp Sci, Nsukka, NigeriaHilla Limann Tech Univ, Sch Appl Sci & Technol, Wa, GhanaLadoke Akintola Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Ogbomosho, Nigeria	Hilla Limann Tech UnivLadoke Akintola Univ Technol			2023-11-08	WOS:001088502300012

However, reality may not agree with what is modeled. Conformance checking techniques reveal and diagnose differences between the behavior that is modeled and what is observed. Existing conformance checking approaches tend to focus on the control-flow in a process, while abstracting from data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints. Even in those situations when other perspectives are considered, the control-flow is aligned first, i.e., priority is given to this perspective. Data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints are only considered as "second-class citizens", which may lead to misleading conformance diagnostics. For example, a data attribute may provide strong evidence that the wrong activity was executed. Existing techniques will still diagnose the data-flow as deviating, whereas our approach will indeed point out that the control-flow is deviating. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed that balances the deviations with respect to all these perspectives based on a customizable cost function. Evaluations using both synthetic and real data sets show that a multi-perspective approach is indeed feasible and may help to circumvent misleading results as generated by classical single-perspective or staged approaches.									136	7	0	0	1	0	149			0010-485X	1436-5057										Tech Univ Eindhoven, Dept Math & Comp Sci, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, NetherlandsVrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, NetherlandsPercept Software, Naarden, NetherlandsNatl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Int Lab Proc Aware Informat Syst, Moscow, Russia	Percept Software			2016-04-20	WOS:000372901400004

These methods rely on accurate wall motion detection and appropriate model boundary conditions. In this study, multi-perspective ultrasound is combined with finite element models to perform mechanical characterization of abdominal aortas in volunteers.Multi-perspective biplane radio frequency ultrasound recordings were made under seven angles (-45 degrees to 45 degrees) in one phantom set-up and eight volunteers, which were merged using automatic image registration. 2-D displacement fields were estimated in the seven longitudinal ultrasound views, creating a sparse, high resolution 3-D map of the wall motion at relatively high frame rates (20-27 Hz). The displacements were used to personalize the subject-specific finite element model of which the geometry of the aorta, spine, and surrounding tissue were determined from a single 3-D ultrasound acquisition.Automatic registration of the multi-perspective images was successful in six out of eight cases with an average error of 5.4 degrees compared to the ground truth. Displacements of the aortic wall were measured and cyclic strain of the aortic diameter was found ranging from 4.2% to 8.6%. The subject-specific mesh and inverse FE analysis was performed yielding shear moduli estimates for the wall between 104 and 215 kPa. Comparative results from a single-perspective workflow revealed very low aortic wall motion signal, which resulted in relatively high modulus estimates, between 230 and 754 kPa.Multi-perspective biplane ultrasound imaging was used to personalize finite element models of the abdominal aorta and its surroundings, and performing mechanical characterization of the aortic shear modulus. The method was found to be a more robust method compared to a single-perspective 3-D ultrasound approach. Future research will focus on investigating the use of multiple 3-D ultrasound acquisitions, the feasibility of free-hand scanning, the creation of a full 3-D automatic registration process, and with that, enable a clinical continuation of this study.									10	1	0	0	5	0	11			1751-6161	1878-0180										Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Photoacoust & Ultrasound Lab Eindhoven PULS E, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, MB, NetherlandsCatharina Hosp, Dept Vasc Surg, Michelangelolaan 2, NL-5623 EJ Eindhoven, NetherlandsEindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Cardiovasc Biomech Grp, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, MB, Netherlands				2021-06-11	WOS:000652618800002	33865067

As such, it is critical that researchers study the senses in concert. That said, the few empirical studies that have attempted to assess the impact of deliberately combining the senses in a retail/health-care environment have typically failed to deliver the multi-sensory boost to experience (or sales) that the multi-sensory science predicts ought to be observed. Invoking notions of processing fluency, sensory overload and sensory (in-) congruency in the field of multi-sensory atmospherics may help to explain what happened (or went wrong) in such cases. Design/methodology/approach Critical review of literature on atmospherics and sensory marketing, highlighting various difficulties of interpretation and challenges to accepted conclusions. Findings Atmospherics is a fundamentally multi-sensory concept, and cross-modal interactions are the rule, not the exception. As such, researchers need to study atmospherics in a multi-sensory context. Originality/value This critical commentary highlights the need for researchers to consider atmospherics from a multi-sensory, rather than sense-by-sense perspective.									12	0	0	0	1	1	13			1352-2752	1758-7646										Univ Oxford, Dept Expt Psychol, Oxford, England				2022-11-25	WOS:000884469400010

However, as the volume and dimensionality of sensory-feedback increase it might be difficult to manually design a multimodal-data fusion system that can handle heterogeneous data. Nowadays, multi-modal machine learning is an emerging field with research focused mainly on analyzing vision and audio information. Although, from the robotics perspective, haptic sensations experienced from interaction with an environment are essential to successfully execute useful tasks. In our work, we compared four learning-based multi-modal fusion methods on three publicly available datasets containing haptic signals, images, and robots' poses. During tests, we considered three tasks involving such data, namely grasp outcome classification, texture recognition, and-most challenging-multi-label classification of haptic adjectives based on haptic and visual data. Conducted experiments were focused not only on the verification of the performance of each method but mainly on their robustness against data degradation. We focused on this aspect of multi-modal fusion, as it was rarely considered in the research papers, and such degradation of sensory feedback might occur during robot interaction with its environment. Additionally, we verified the usefulness of data augmentation to increase the robustness of the aforementioned data fusion methods.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			2079-9292											Poznan Univ Tech, Inst Robot & Machine Intelligence, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland				2020-08-12	WOS:000554142800001

This multi-language system allows modellers to express a specific system characteristic with the most appropriate modelling languages and notations. With the proliferation of independently developed and continually evolving modelling languages, it becomes more challenging to reuse or combine multiple languages in a multi-language modelling environment. In this paper, we present a framework for the specification and development of multi-language systems based on perspectives to promote modularity in language reuse, inter-language consistency, and combination of languages. A perspective groups different languages for a modelling purpose and defines the role of each participating language. Furthermore, a perspective defines composite actions for building a consistent multi-model system and maintaining the links between different model elements. These actions are specified by re-exposing, combining, or redefining existing language actions (e.g. create an operation in a class diagram model) offered by the languages that the perspective reuses. The aim of this framework is to streamline the combination of multiple languages in a system and allow the perspective designer to focus only on specifying relationships between different languages. A generative approach then ensures appropriate language registration and model consistencies, hence freeing the perspective designer from the error-prone implementation of the consistency mechanism and simplifying the modular combination of different languages. We illustrate our approach with a perspective aimed at requirement elicitation and specification that combines five different languages, i.e. class diagrams, use case diagrams, collaboration diagrams, use case maps, and a domain-specific modelling language.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1614-5046	1614-5054										McGill Univ, 845 Sherbrooke St W, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G4, Canada				2022-01-22	WOS:000743009200001

The plurality function chooses for the consensus all alternatives that receive the largest number of first choices. We state a characterization of the plurality function interpreted as giving a vector of 0's and 1's, with the 1 representing membership in the consensus subset. The problem of generalizing this result in various ways gives new insight into the plurality function and leads to the problem of solving an interesting new functional equation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0165-4896											RUTGERS STATE UNIV,CTR OPERAT RES,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903				1991-10-01	WOS:A1991HA00400005

We are given n balls, each of them is colored with one out of c colors. At any step of the game, Paul chooses two balls and asks whether they are of the same color, whereupon Carole answers yes or no. The game ends when Paul either produces a ball a of the plurality color (meaning that the number of balls colored like a exceeds those of the other colors), or when Paul states that there is no plurality. How many questions L, (n) does Paul have to ask in the worst case?For c = 2, the problem is equivalent to the well-known majority problem which has already been solved (Combinatorica 11 (1991) 383-387). In this paper we show that 3 [n/2]-2 <= L-3 (n) <= [5n/3]-2. Moreover, for any c <= n, we show that surprisingly the naive algorithm for the plurality problem is asymptotically optimal.

Ultrasound imaging has proven to be a valuable tool to quantify these deformations. However, strain is not always measured accurately in vital parts of the heart when only using a single probe, even at a high frame rate, because of the anisotropic spatial resolution and contrast. Therefore, a multi-perspective ultrafast ultrasound (US) strain imaging method was developed, aiming at investigating improvements in strain while operating two probes at different relative angles. In an ex-vivo experiment of a beating porcine heart, parasternal short axis views of the left ventricle (LV) were acquired by two phased array probes with different relative angles (30 degrees-75 degrees) at a frame rate of 170 frames per second (FPS). A fully automatic registration algorithm was developed to register the image datasets for all cases. Next, radio frequency (RF) based strain imaging was performed. Axial displacements were compounded based on the unit axial vectors of the dual probes to improve motion tracking and strain estimation. After performing multi-perspective strain imaging, compounded radial and circumferential strain both improve compared to single probe strain imaging. While increasing the inter-probe angle from 30 degrees to 75 degrees, the mean tracking error (ME), mean drift error (MDE) and strain variability (SV) decreased, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) increased for both strain components. For the largest angle (75 degrees), large reductions in ME (-42%), MDE (-50%) and SV (-48%) were observed. The SNRe increased by 253 and 39% for radial and circumferential strain, respectively, and strain curves revealed less noise for each region. In summary, a multi-perspective ultrafast US strain imaging method was introduced to improve cardiac strain estimation in an ex-vivo beating porcine heart setup.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			2296-424X											Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Photoacoust & Ultrasound Lab Eindhoven PULS E, Eindhoven, Netherlands				2022-05-29	WOS:000797883000001

Conformance checking is a branch of this discipline embracing approaches for verifying whether the behavior of a process, as recorded in a log, is in line with some expected behavior provided in the form of a process model. Recently, techniques for conformance checking based on declarative specifications have been developed. Such specifications are suitable to describe processes characterized by high variability. However, an open challenge in the context of conformance checking with declarative models is the capability of supporting multi-perspective specifications. This means that declarative models used for conformance checking should not only describe the process behavior from the control flow point of view, but also from other perspectives like data or time. In this paper, we close this gap by presenting an approach for conformance checking based on MP-Declare, a multi-perspective version of the declarative process modeling language Declare. The approach has been implemented in the process mining tool ProM and has been experimented using artificial and real-life event logs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, because of physical constraints, drawbacks of US include limited field-of-view, refraction, resolution and contrast anisotropy. These issues cannot be resolved when using a single probe. Here, an interleaved multi-perspective 2-D US imaging system was introduced, aiming at improved imaging of the left ventricle (LV) of the heart by acquiring US data from two separate phased array probes simultaneously at a high frame rate.In an ex-vivo experiment of a beating porcine heart, parasternal long-axis and apical views of the left ventricle were acquired using two phased array probes. Interleaved multi-probe US data were acquired at a frame rate of 170 frames per second (FPS) using diverging wave imaging under 11 angles. Image registration and fusion algorithms were developed to align and fuse the US images from two different probes.First-and second-order speckle statistics were computed to characterize the resulting probability distribution function and point spread function of the multi-probe image data. First-order speckle analysis showed less overlap of the histograms (reduction of 34.4%) and higher contrast-to noise ratio (CNR, increase of 27.3%) between endocardium and myocardium in the fused images. Autocorrelation results showed an improved and more isotropic resolution for the multi-perspective images (single perspective: 0.59 mm x 0.21 mm, multi-perspective: 0.35 mm x 0.18 mm). Moreover, mean gradient (MG) (increase of 74.4%) and entropy (increase of 23.1%) results indicated that image details of the myocardial tissue can be better observed after fusion.To conclude, interleaved multi-perspective high frame rate US imaging was developed and demonstrated in an ex-vivo experimental setup, revealing enlarged field-of-view, and improved image contrast and resolution of cardiac images.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0041-624X	1874-9968										Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Photoacoust & Ultrasound Lab Eindhoven PULS e, Eindhoven, Netherlands				2022-05-12	WOS:000790509300003	35189524

In order to detect exceptions effectively, exception monitoring requires proper understanding of the possible exceptions. However, the extant exception monitoring approaches or systems still lack sufficient emphasis in exceptions understanding. This paper presents a novel outbound logistics exception monitoring approach by incorporating multi-perspective ontologies and intelligent agents. Specially, the multi-perspective ontologies, involving static ontology, social ontology and dynamic ontology, are firstly employed to develop the taxonomy of the logistics exception, to reflect the situation dependencies of logistics exception and to represent the dynamic nature of business processes. From this point forwards, an outbound exception monitoring system is designed by introducing multi-intelligent agents, which can ensure autonomous, flexible, and collaborative exception monitor in logistics service. Finally, the presented approach and designed system are exhibited through a case study of two ubiquitous logistics exceptions, which indicates that the proposed multi-perspective ontologies provide better understanding of exceptions thereby enabling the designed outbound exception monitoring system to perform well.

It is further applied to mine the other perspectives such as time, data, and resources by replaying the events in event logs over the initial process model. When process mining is extended far beyond discovering the control-flow models to capture additional perspectives; roles, bottlenecks, amounts of time passed, guards, and routing probabilities in the process can be identified. This is a such extensions are considered under the topic of multi-perspective process mining, which makes the discovered process model more understandable. In this study, a framework for applying multi-perspective process mining and creating a Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) process model as the output is introduced. The framework, which uses a recently developed application programming interface (API) for storing the BPMN Data Model which keeps what is produced from each perspective as an asset into a private blockchain in a secure and immutable way, has been developed as a plugin to the ProM tool. In doing so, it integrates a number of techniques for multi-perspective process mining in literature, for the perspectives of control-flow, data, and resource; and represents a holistic process model by combining the outputs of these in the BPMN Data Model. In this article, we explain technical details of the framework and also demonstrate its usage over a case in medical domain.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1547-1063	1551-0018										ASELSAN Inc, Ankara, TurkeyHacettepe Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Ankara, Turkey				2022-11-05	WOS:000871887300006	36124615

However, managing inconsistency is not just a pure technical problem. It is always associated with a process of interactions and competitions among corresponding stakeholders. The main contribution of this paper is to present a negotiations approach to handling inconsistencies in multi-perspective software requirements. In particular, the priority of requirements relative to each perspective plays an important role in proceeding negotiation over resolving inconsistencies among different stakeholders. An algorithm of generating negotiation proposals and an approach to evaluating proposals are also presented in this paper, respectively.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1009-6124	1559-7067										Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Acad Math & Syst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaUniv Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia				2008-12-01	WOS:000260878200007

Additionally, we propose a set of heuristics for setting the threshold of an anomaly detection algorithm automatically. We demonstrate that BINet can be used to detect anomalies in event logs not only at a case level but also at event attribute level. Finally, we demonstrate that a simple set of rules can be used to utilize the output of BINet for anomaly classification.

However, few studies have used bibliometrics for conducting a global picture of the MLP research. This study identifies the worldwide trends at three levels: sources, authors, and documents, and uses the bibliometrix based on 757 articles published in WOS and Scopus from 2002 to 2020. The results show that the MLP research literature is proliferating, and the number of journals and countries concerned in this field is increasing. MLP research has mainly focused on transition, sustainability transition, socio-technical transition, energy transition, innovation, and governance; and will increase focus on agency, power, and policy. MLP research will focus on multi-niche, multi-regime, and multi-landscape interactions at the hierarchy levels. The results assist scholars in systematically understanding the current research status, research frontiers, and future trends of MLP from a macro perspective.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16				2071-1050										China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaHuaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Foreign Languages, Huaian 223300, Peoples R ChinaNingbo Univ Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Ningbo 315048, Peoples R ChinaHuaiyin Normal Univ, Res Dept, Huaian 223300, Peoples R ChinaRizhao Tiantai Construct & Installat Engn Co Ltd, Rizhao 276800, Peoples R China	Rizhao Tiantai Construct & Installat Engn Co Ltd			2022-04-24	WOS:000781879100001

The fault diagnosis based on vibration signals is encountering difficulties as nonlinearity, high complexity, strong coupling, and high uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-perspective architecture for fault diagnosis, based on variational mode decomposition and enhanced multi-scale convolutional neural network. The proposed method provides multiple perspectives for the multi-channel and multi-component signal analysis, including perspectives from channel, component and time scale, with low input dimension and reduced model complexity. Signal features under different perspectives can be adaptively extracted. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on high-speed train fault data and rolling element bearings dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme not only improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis but also has superior noise robustness which could be valuable for practical applications of complex systems, especially in dynamic environments.									27	2	0	0	0	0	28			0924-669X	1573-7497										Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Elect Engn, 999 Xian Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China				2019-11-19	WOS:000494049700011

While existing next basket recommendation models focus on user-item relationships and latent temporal patterns, they often neglect the impact of actual temporal information in interaction data. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework that explores how multi-perspective temporal information fusion can enhance prediction accuracy. The framework consists of two key modules: the latent temporal information extraction module, which analyzes the item perspective to capture the evolution of user preferences; and the actual temporal information extraction module, which examines the time perspective to reveal the preference differences of users at different time points. By fusing multi-perspective temporal information, the framework can more comprehensively capture the dynamic changes in user interests, thus improving the accuracy of recommendations. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and emphasize the importance of temporal information in next basket recommendation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-8542	1573-0484										Jiangxi Normal Univ, Res Ctr Management Sci & Engn, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R ChinaJiangxi Prov Engn Res Ctr Blockchain Data Secur &, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R ChinaJiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Software, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R ChinaJiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Digital Ind, Shangrao 334000, Peoples R ChinaJiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Nanchang 330022, Peoples R China	Jiangxi Prov Engn Res Ctr Blockchain Data Secur &			2025-06-21	WOS:001509928600003		
S	Gasser, L						Luck, M; Marik, V; Stepankova, O; Trappl, R				Perspectives on organizations in multi-agent systems								MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS		LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		2086				1	16											Article; Proceedings Paper	2001	2001	The aim of this paper is to illustrate and sensitize reader to the variety of perspectives and the fundamental nature of organizations as stable/stabilizing systems and as multi-perspective action systems. Researchers have been explicitly thinking about MAS/DAI organizations and attempting to link formal (human) organization theory with MAS/DAI models for at least twenty years. Despite this, the idea of organizations has been a peripheral theme in MAS/DAI research --- primarily a specific coordination technique --- not really one of the central intellectual issues of the field. The theory of 'natural' organizations has a somewhat longer, more diverse, and more thorough intellectual history than that of organizations in MAS. Beyond recent work in human social and organization theory, some newer research on abstract organizations has been attempting to unify concepts in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computing theory (e.g., the lambda calculus), with those of natural social organizations and multi-agent systems. The landscape for thinking about organizations in MAS is growing quite interesting, and this paper surveys this landscape. It presents and contrasts some conceptions of organization that have emerged and proven useful, and attempts to show how these have been implemented, experimented with, and applied. It also projects some future directions for research on MAS organizations, and gives some thoughts on where the most exciting issues lie.					9th Advanced Course on Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2001)/3rd European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS 2001)9th Advanced Course on Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2001)/3rd European Agent Systems Summer School (EASSS 2001)	JUL 02-13, 2001JUL 02-13, 2001	European Coordinating Comm Artificial Intelligence; AgentLinkEuropean Coordinating Comm Artificial Intelligence; AgentLink	PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLICPRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC	30	0	0	0	0	0	30			0302-9743		3-540-42312-5									Univ Illinois, Grad Sch Lib & Informat Sci, Champaign, IL 61820 USA				2001-01-01	WOS:000175099100001

However, effective aggregation of local and nonlocal contexts information in the document continues to be a challenging research question. This study proposes a novel document-level RE model, called the multi-perspective context aggregation (MPCA), that aggregates document context information from multi-perspective at different layers. Specifically, this aggregated context information not only comes from the pre-training stage but is also reflected during node construction and classification. Experimental results show that our model achieves desirable performance on two public datasets for document-level RE and is particularly effective in extracting relations between entities with multiple mentions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0924-669X	1573-7497										PLA Strateg Support Force Informat Engn Univ, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China				2022-07-20	WOS:000823355900004

The difficult and ubiquitous problems of multiplicities								PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS				6	3			155	160				10.1002/pst.303							Article	JUL-SEP 2007	2007	Multiplicities are ubiquitous. They threaten every inference in every aspect of life. Despite the focus in statistics on multiplicities, statisticians underestimate their importance. One reason is that the focus is on methodology for known multiplicities. Silent multiplicities are much more important and they are insidious. Both frequentists and Bayesians have important contributions to make regarding problems of multiplicities. But neither group has an inside track. Frequentists and Bayesians working together is a promising way of making inroads into this knotty set of problems. Two experiments with identical results may well lead to very different statistical conclusions. So we will never be able to use a software package with default settings to resolve all Problems of multiplicities. Every problem has unique aspects. And all problems require understanding the substantive area of application.

Some tools are commonly used to ensure the total registration of the crime scene with a minimal human interference. As a novel tool, we propose, here, an intelligent system that remotely recognizes and localizes objects considered as important evidences at a crime scene. Starting from a general viewpoint of the scene, a drone system defines trajectories through which the aerial vehicle performs a detailed search to record evidences. A multi-perspective detection approach is introduced by analyzing several images of the same object in order to improve the reliability of the object recognition. To the best of authors' knowledge, it is the first work on remote autonomous sensing of crime scenes. Experiments demonstrated an accuracy increase of 18.2% points, when using multi-perspective detection.									11	0	0	0	0	0	12			1545-598X	1558-0571										Univ Fed Bahia, IvisionLab, BR-40170110 Salvador, BA, Brazil				2020-07-14	WOS:000543724300036

In turn, the modelling opportunities with languages such as Declare are less intuitive and hard to implement. The area of process discovery covers the automatic discovery of process models. It has been shown that the performance of process mining algorithms, particularly when considering the multi-perspective declarative process models, are not satisfactory. State-of-the-art mining tools do not support multi-perspective declarative models at this moment. We address this open research problem by proposing an efficient mining framework that leverages the latest big data analysis technology and builds upon the distributed processing method MapReduce. The paper at hand further completes the research on multi-perspective declarative process mining by extending our previous work in various ways; in particular, we introduce algorithms and descriptions for the full set of commonly accepted types of MP-Declare constraints. Additionally, we provide a novel implementation concept allowing an easy introduction and discovery of customised constraint templates. We evaluated the mining performance and effectiveness of the presented approach on several real-life event logs. The results highlight that, with our efficient mining technique, multi-perspective declarative process models can be extracted in reasonable time.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2078-2489										Univ Bayreuth, Inst Comp Sci, D-95447 Bayreuth, Germany				2019-03-12	WOS:000459747300028

At a dyadic level, the perceived expertise of a source, in addition to strength of ties, exerts a positive effect on knowledge transfer. Additionally, a recipient's network centrality moderates the effects of dyadic relationships on knowledge transfer.Research limitations/implications - This study deepened the current understanding of the role of social capital in knowledge transfer from a recipient's perspective. Three dimensions of a recipient's social capital respectively showed significant, but different types of influence on knowledge transfer. Interaction effects between individual and dyadic level antecedents should be considered as well.Practical implications - Both a strong tie at a dyadic level and a diverse network at an individual level should be nurtured to facilitate knowledge transfer. In addition, bi-directional knowledge transfer between seasoned employees and new employees should be promoted.Originality/value - Most studies have focused on motivating a knowledge source, assuming that a recipient is always ready to adopt a source's knowledge. To reduce this bias, the current study examined social capital's role in knowledge transfer from a recipient's perspective.									33	0	0	0	0	0	43			1367-3270	1758-7484										Konkuk Univ, Dept Adv Ind Fus, Seoul, South KoreaYeungnam Univ, Sch Business, Gyongsan, South Korea				2014-10-08	WOS:000341928700006

Hence, they are well suited for modelling knowledge-intensive processes with many decision points. However, such models can be hard to read and understand, which affect the modelling and maintenance of the process models tremendously as well as their execution. When executing such declarative (multi-perspective) process models, it may happen that the execution of activities or the change of data values may result in the non-executability of crucial activities. Hence, it would be beneficial to know all consequences of decisions to give recommendations to the process participants. A look-ahead attempts to predict the effects of executing an activity towards possible consequences within an a priori defined time window. The prediction is based on the current state of the process execution, the intended next event and the underlying process model. While execution engines for single-perspective imperative process models already implement such functionality, execution approaches, for multi-perspective declarative process models that involve constraints on data and resources, are less mature. In this paper, we introduce a simulation-based look-ahead approach for multi-perspective declarative process models. This approach transforms the problem of a context-aware process simulation into a SAT problem, by translating a declarative multi-perspective process model and the current state of a process execution into a specification of the logic language Alloy. Via a SAT solver, process trajectories are generated that either satisfy or violate this specification. The simulated process trajectories are used to derive consequences and effects of certain decisions at any time of process execution. We evaluate our approach by means of three examples and give some advice for further optimizations.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1619-1366	1619-1374										Univ Bayreuth, Inst Comp Sci, Bayreuth, GermanyUniv Bayreuth, Inst Comp Sci, Comp Sci, Bayreuth, GermanyUniv Regensburg, Informat Syst, Inst Management Informat Syst, Regensburg, Germany				2021-01-26	WOS:000606351200002

These have limited the applications of the light field in practice. To solve the problems above, this article introduces the multi-perspective distributed information fusion into light field reconstruction to monitor and recognize the maneuvering targets. First, the light field is represented as sub-light fields at different perspectives (i.e. the Multi-sensor distributed network), and sparse representation and reconstruction are then performed. Second, we establish the multi-perspective distributed information fusion under the condition of regional full-coverage constraints. Finally, the light field data from multiple perspectives are fused and the states of the maneuvering targets are estimated. Experimental results show that the light field reconstruction time of the proposed method is less than 583 s, and the reconstruction accuracy exceeds 92.447% compared with the existing spatially variable bidirectional reflectance distribution function, micro-lens array, and others. In the aspect of maneuvering target recognition, the recognition time of the algorithm in this article is no more than 3.5 s. The recognition accuracy of the algorithm in this article is up to 86.739%. Moreover, the more viewing angles used, the higher the accuracy.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1550-1477											Henan Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Informat & Engn, Xinxiang 453003, Henan, Peoples R ChinaShandong Univ, Sch Control Sci & Engn, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China				2019-08-27	WOS:000482086100001

They have very nice theoretical properties and have proven to be efficient in many real life applications but the design of SVM training algorithms often gives rise to challenging optimization issues. We propose here to review the basics of Support Vector Machine learning from a multi-agent optimization perspective. Multi-agents systems break down complex optimization problems into elementary "oracle" tasks and perform a collaborative solving process resulting in a self-organized solution of the complex problems. We show how the SVM training problem can also be "tackled" from this point of view and provide several perspectives for binary classification, hyperparameters selection, multiclass learning as well as unsupervised learning. This conceptual work is illustrated through simple examples in order to convey the ideas and understand the behavior of agent cooperation. The proposed models provide simple formulations of complex learning tasks that are sometimes very difficult to solve with classical optimization strategies. The ideas that are discussed open up perspectives for the design of new distributed cooperative learning systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We prove that, under some assumptions on the singularity, the multiplicity modulo 2 is preserved by subanalytic bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms of a"e (n) . In the first part of the paper, we find a subset of the tangent cone which determines the multiplicity mod 2 and prove that this subset of S (n) is preserved by the antipodal map. The study of such subsets of S (n) enables us to deduce the subanalytic metric invariance of the multiplicity modulo 2 under some extra assumptions on the tangent cone. We also prove a real version of a theorem of Comte, and yield that the multiplicity modulo 2 is preserved by arc-analytic bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0179-5376											Univ Toronto, Dept Math, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, Canada				2010-04-01	WOS:000274331500012

Economic issues such as inflation, energy costs, taxes and interest rates persist and are further exacerbated by global events such as wars, pandemics and environmental disasters. A sustained history of financial crises exposes weaknesses in modern economies. The Great Attrition, with many quitting jobs, adds to concerns. The diversity of the workforce poses new challenges. Transformative approaches are essential to safeguard societies, economies and the planet. In this work, we use big data and machine learning methods to discover multi-perspective parameters for multi-generational labour markets. The parameters for the academic perspective are discovered using 35,000 article abstracts from the Web of Science for the period 1958-2022 and for the professionals' perspective using 57,000 LinkedIn posts from 2022. We discover a total of 28 parameters and categorized them into five macro-parameters, Learning & Skills, Employment Sectors, Consumer Industries, Learning & Employment Issues and Generations-specific Issues.

If unaddressed, problems of multiplicity can undermine integrity of statistical inferences. The tutorial reviews key concepts in multiple hypothesis testing and introduces main classes of methods for addressing multiplicity in a clinical trial setting. General guidelines for the development of relevant and efficient multiple testing procedures are presented on the basis of application-specific clinical and statistical information. Case studies with common multiplicity problems are used to motivate and illustrate the statistical methods presented in the tutorial, and software implementation of the multiplicity adjustment methods is discussed.

We present multi-perspective region-based neural networks that leverage knowledge of the imaging geometry for automatic vertebrae labeling in Long-Film images - a novel to-mographic imaging modality with an extended field-of-view for spine imaging.Method: A multi-perspective network architecture was designed to exploit small view-angle dispari-ties produced by a multi-slot collimator and consolidate information from overlapping image regions. A second network incorporates large view-angle disparities to jointly perform labeling on images from multiple views (viz., AP and lateral). A recurrent module incorporates contextual information and en-force anatomical order for the detected vertebrae. The three modules are combined to form the multi -view multi-slot (MVMS) network for labeling vertebrae using images from all available perspectives. The network was trained on images synthesized from 297 CT images and tested on 50 AP and 50 lateral Long-Film images acquired from 13 cadaveric specimens. Labeling performance of the multi-perspective networks was evaluated with respect to the number of vertebrae appearances and presence of surgical instrumentation.Results: The MVMS network achieved an F1 score of > 96% and an average vertebral localization error of 3.3 mm, with 88.3% labeling accuracy on both AP and lateral images - (15.5% and 35.0% higher than conventional Faster R-CNN on AP and lateral views, respectively). Aggregation of multiple appearances of the same vertebra using the multi-slot network significantly improved the labeling accuracy ( p < 0.05). Using the multi-view network, labeling accuracy on the more challenging lateral views was improved to the same level as that of the AP views. The approach demonstrated robustness to the presence of surgical instrumentation, commonly encountered in intraoperative images, and achieved comparable performance in images with and without instrumentation (88.9% vs. 91.2% labeling accuracy).Conclusion: The MVMS network demonstrated effective multi-perspective aggregation, providing means for accurate, automated vertebrae labeling during spine surgery. The algorithms may be generalized to other imaging tasks and modalities that involve multiple views with view-angle disparities (e.g., bi-plane radiography). Predicted labels can help avoid adverse events during surgery (e.g., wrong-level surgery), establish correspondence with labels in preoperative modalities to facilitate image registration, and en-able automated measurement of spinal alignment metrics for intraoperative assessment of spinal curva-ture.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We propose that the perspectives which need to be represented can be characterized as who, what, how, when, where and why knowledge; these perspectives, and necessary levels of abstraction, are captured by the Zachman framework for Information Systems Architecture. We suggest modelling techniques that might be appropriate for different perspectives and levels of abstraction, and illustrate using examples from a medical domain. We also describe how an individual perspective can become the user interface of a knowledge distribution system, and illustrate this by describing the protocol assistant, a Web-based knowledge-based system capable of representing and reasoning with best practice guidelines ("protocols") in the medical domain.

The major challenge in entity disambiguation is how to extract key imformation in mention context and entity description that is discriminative for disambiguation. State-of-the-art entity disambiguation systems apply attention mechanism to identify the imformative components, but most of the methods only focus on mention context, and neglect entity side. Besides, attention mechanism is employed in a single aspect, which may not be effective in difficult circumstances. In this work, we propose a neural network with multi-perspective attention to enrich the representation of mentions and entities in different perspectives. Specifically, we utilize intra-attention to aggregate internal pivotal information in mention context and entity description separately, and utilize inter-attention to interact their latent semantics in multiple directions and highlight the interrelated information, so as to capture more informative features and improve the disambiguation performance. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art entity disambiguation models and attain more improvements on hard datasets, which validates the effectiveness and superiority of our model, especially in complex situations.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2169-3536											Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Elect Elect & Commun Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Elect, Key Lab Network Informat Syst Technol NIST, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China				2020-12-10	WOS:000483022100048

This paper presents a multi-perspective modelling approach to systematically manage distributed manufacturing knowledge on the SW. Considering knowledge engineering as a cyclic and constructive modelling process, a multi-perspective knowledge modelling process is proposed to evolve along knowledge elicitation, engineering modelling, UML-based object modelling, OWL-based ontology modelling, knowledge formalisation and OWL-QL assisted knowledge verification activities. The proposed approach is viewed as a promising knowledge management method that facilitates the implementation of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) in distributed manufacturing for SW applications by integrating the industrial, UML enabled software engineering techniques into recent ontology-based knowledge engineering process. The feasibility of knowledge management through multi-perspective modelling is manifested using the manufacturing ontology for manufacturing electronic connectors.									16	0	0	0	0	0	18			0020-7543	1366-588X										Zhejiang Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaHangzhou Dianzi Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2009-01-01	WOS:000272986900003

Many orchestration algorithms have been published focusing on different tasks for the life cycle of network services. Nowadays, some general-purpose and architectural orchestration surveys have been published. However, currently, no survey classifies and evaluates distributed multi-domain orchestration algorithms. In this survey, we focus on multi-domain orchestration works from an algorithmic perspective by considering the cooperative and competitive approaches. Algorithms are classified and evaluated. We propose a taxonomy for works that consider different life cycle tasks of network services and evaluate them in the light of well-defined key requirements. This allows us to have a perspective on the current state of multi-domain orchestration algorithms. We also identify future research directions based on the current perspective.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0163-6804	1558-1896										CNRS, Lab Anal & Architecture Syst, Paris, FranceINSA, Villeurbanne, Auvergne Rhone, FranceUniv Toulouse, Toulouse, FranceINAOE, Paris, France	INAOE			2022-09-08	WOS:000844513900016

CDNs improve the connectivity and efficiency of global communications, but their caching mechanisms may be breached by cyber-attackers. Among the security mechanisms, effective anomaly detection forms an important part of CDN security enhancement. In this work, we propose a multi-perspective unsupervised learning framework for anomaly detection in CDNs. In the proposed framework, a multi-perspective feature engineering approach, an optimized unsupervised anomaly detection model that utilizes an isolation forest and a Gaussian mixture model, and a multi-perspective validation method, are developed to detect abnormal behaviors in CDNs mainly from the client Internet Protocol (IP) and node perspectives, therefore to identify the denial of service (DoS) and cache pollution attack (CPA) patterns. Experimental results are presented based on the analytics of eight days of real-world CDN log data provided by a major CDN operator. Through experiments, the abnormal contents, compromised nodes, malicious IPs, as well as their corresponding attack types, are identified effectively by the proposed framework and validated by multiple cybersecurity experts. This shows the effectiveness of the proposed method when applied to real-world CDN data.									19	0	0	0	0	0	20			1932-4537											Western Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, London, ON N6A 3K7, CanadaEricsson Montreal, Internet Things, St Laurent, PQ H4S 0B6, CanadaEricsson Montreal, Res Secur, St Laurent, PQ H4S 0B6, CanadaEricsson Montreal, One Network, St Laurent, PQ H4S 0B6, Canada	Ericsson MontrealEricsson MontrealEricsson Montreal			2022-03-24	WOS:000767855700048

For instance, the networks can not efficiently analyze the perspective information of arbitrary scenes, and they are naturally inefficient to handle the scale variations. In this work, we deliver a simple yet efficient multi-column network, which integrates the perspective analysis method with the counting network. The proposed method explicitly excavates the perspective information and drives the counting network to analyze the scenes. More concretely, we explore the perspective information from the estimated density maps and quantify the perspective space into several separate scenes. We then embed the perspective analysis into the multi-column framework with a recurrent connection. Therefore, the proposed network matches various scales with the different receptive fields efficiently. Secondly, we share the parameters of the branches with various receptive fields. This strategy drives the convolutional kernels to be sensitive to the instances with various scales. Furthermore, to improve the evaluation accuracy of the column with a large receptive field, we propose a transform dilated convolution. The transform dilated convolution breaks the fixed sampling structure of the deep network. Moreover, it needs no extra parameters and training, and the offsets are constrained in a local region, which is designed for the congested scenes. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets (ShanghaiTech, UCF CC 50, WorldEXPO'10, UCSD, and TRANCOS).									48	2	0	0	1	0	50			1057-7149	1941-0042										Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaSUNY Albany, Comp Sci Dept, Albany, NY 12222 USAUniv Trento, Dept Informat Engn & Comp Sci, I-38123 Trento, Italy				2021-01-01	WOS:000604831700002	33315562

One of the main challenges of EM is attribute heterogeneity, that is, there are many different types of attributes in an entity. Present researches focus on using rules or neural networks to select similarity measures for different types of attributes. However, they select only one specific similarity measure for each attribute but ignore matching information from many other aspects. In addition, existing methods neglect the fact that different attributes have different contributions to final matching decision, and do not consider the influence of dirty data on matching results. In this paper, we propose an entity matching method based on attribute-aware and multi-perspective similarity measurement. Firstly, we propose a multi-perspective similarity measurement framework based on pre-trained language model DeBERTa to achieve the comprehensive multi-perspective similarity computation, which will capture the matching information from multiple perspectives such as literal, size and semantics. Secondly, we introduce an attribute attention mechanism to aggregate matching evidences from all aligned attributes according to the importance of each attribute for final matching decision. Finally, we use cross-attribute comparison to solve dirty data problems such as swap errors, and we further improve our model's matching capability through injecting external entity knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework for entity matching outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-world data sets.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1016-2364											Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China				2023-08-15	WOS:001040525800001

The overall aim is to unburden the surgeon and OR staff from both manual maintenance and information seeking tasks. A major step toward intelligent systems behavior is a stable classification of the surgical situation from multiple perspectives based on performed low-level tasks.Material and methods: The present work proposes a method for the classification of surgical situations based on multi-perspective workflow modeling. A model network that interconnects different types of surgical process models is described. Various aspects of a surgical situation description were considered: low-level tasks, high-level tasks, patient status, and the use of medical devices. A study with sixty neurosurgical interventions was conducted to evaluate the performance of our approach and its robustness against incomplete workflow recognition input.Results: A correct classification rate of over 90% was measured for high-level tasks and patient status. The device usage models for navigation and neurophysiology classified over 95% of the situations correctly, whereas the ultrasound usage was more difficult to predict. Overall, the classification rate decreased with an increasing level of input distortion.Discussion: Autonomous adaptation of medical devices and intelligent systems behavior do not currently depend solely on low-level tasks. Instead, they require a more general type of understanding of the surgical condition. The integration of various surgical process models in a network provided a comprehensive representation of the interventions and allowed for the generation of extensive situation descriptions.Conclusion: Multi-perspective surgical workflow modeling and online situation models will be a significant pre-requisite for reliable and intelligent systems behavior. Hence, they will contribute to a cooperative OR environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate predictions have implications for real estate investors, financial institutions, urban planners, and policymakers. However, accurately predicting house prices is challenging due to the complex interplay of various influencing factors. Previous studies have primarily focused on basic property information, leaving room for further exploration of more intricate features, such as amenities, traffic, and social sentiments in the surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to house price prediction from a multi-source data fusion perspective. Our methodology involves analyzing house characteristics and incorporating factors from diverse aspects, including amenities, traffic, and emotions. We validate our approach using a dataset of 28550 real-world transactions in Beijing, China, providing a comprehensive analysis of the drivers influencing house prices. By adopting a multi-source data fusion perspective and considering a wide range of influential factors, our approach offers valuable insights into house price prediction. The findings from this study possess the capability to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of house price prediction models, benefiting stakeholders in the real estate market.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4				2096-0654										Univ Hong Kong, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R ChinaBeihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China				2024-09-21	WOS:001306486900004

Two different perspectives are studied, i.e., that of the transportation agency and that of the household. These perspectives are linked through intermediate outputs and carry-overs generated by the underlying processes associated with each perspective. Within this context, we propose a theoretical representation of a slacks-based dynamic network DEA approach for measuring evacuation performance when a ramp closure evacuation traffic management strategy is considered. This representation requires a theoretical yet tractable conceptual framework that incorporates stakeholder perspectives, evacuation-related systems, processes and their interdependencies. This research combines the dynamic network DEA approach with traffic engineering and socio-behavioral theory of protective action. An initial exploration of the proposed approach allows for the discovery of efficiency interdependencies among perspectives, which in turn provides useful information and insights for the future design of holistic evacuation traffic management strategies.

Various embedding methods convert each bag into a vector in the new feature space based on a representative bag or instance, aiming to extract useful information from the bag. However, since the distribution of instances is related to labels, these methods rely solely on the overall perspective embedding without considering the different distribution characteristics, which will conflate the varied distributions of instances and thus lead to poor classification performance. In this paper, we propose the dual-perspective multi-instance embedding learning with adaptive density distribution mining (DPMIL) algorithm with three new techniques. First, the mutual instance selection technique consists of adaptive density distribution mining and discriminative evaluation. The distribution characteristics of negative instances and heterogeneous instance dissimilarity are effectively exploited to obtain instances with strong representativeness. Second, the embedding technique mines two crucial information of the bag simultaneously. Bags are converted into sequence invariant vectors according to the dual-perspective such that the distinguishability is maintained. Finally, the ensemble technique trains a batch of classifiers. The final model is obtained by weighted voting with the contribution of the dual-perspective embedding information. The experimental results demonstrate that the DPMIL algorithm has higher average accuracy than other compared algorithms, especially on web datasets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-3203	1873-5142										Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Software Engn, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R ChinaSouthwest Petr Univ, Intelligent Oil & Gas Lab, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R ChinaSouthwest Petr Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Chengdu 610500, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Ocean Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Zhoushan 316022, Peoples R China				2024-10-26	WOS:001335803500001

Carol fixes a coloring of it balls with three colors. At each step, Paul chooses a pair of balls and asks Carol whether the balls have the same color. Carol truthfully answers yes or no. In the Plurality problem, Paul wants to find a ball with the most common color. In the Partition problem, Paul wants to partition the balls according to their colors. Paul's goal is to ask Carol the fewest number of questions to reach his goal. We find optimal probabilistic strategies for the Partition problem and the Plurality problem in the considered setting.

It is urgent to help terminal users make appropriate decisions according to real-time network environment and domain requirements, and obtain the optimal resources efficiently from the massive remote sensing resources. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm using fusion of attention and multi-perspective (MRS_AMRA). Based on MRS_AMRA, we further implement an active service recommendation model (MRS_ASRM) for massive multi-source remote sensing resources by combining streaming pushing technology. Firstly, we construct value evaluation functions from multi-perspective in terms of remote sensing users, data and services to enable the adaptive provision of remote sensing resources. Then, we define multi-perspective heuristic policies to support resource discovery, and fusion these policies through the attention network, to achieve the accurate pushing of remote sensing resources. Finally, we implement comparative experiments to simulate accurate recommendation scenarios, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as DIN and Geoportal. Furthermore, MRS_AMRA achieves an average improvement of 10.5% in the recommendation accuracy NDCG@K, and in addition, we developed a prototype system to verify the effectiveness and timeliness of MRS_ASRM.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2072-4292										Suzhou Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Suzhou 215123, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230026, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China	Suzhou Aerosp Informat Res Inst			2023-06-08	WOS:000996608100001

Distributed multi-agent coordination has been a very active subject studied extensively by the systems and control community in last decades, including distributed consensus, formation control, sensor localization, distributed optimization, etc. The aim of this paper is to provide both a comprehensive survey of existing literature in distributed multi-agent coordination and a new perspective in terms of graph Laplacian to categorize the fundamental mechanisms for distributed coordination. For different types of graph Laplacians, we summarize their inherent coordination features and specific research issues. This paper also highlights several promising research directions along with some open problems that are deemed important for future study.									16	7	0	0	0	0	17			2095-9184	2095-9230										Zhejiang Univ, Coll Elect Engn, State Key Lab Ind Control Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaUniv Newcastle, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Callaghan, NSW 2308, AustraliaZhejiang Univ, Dept Control Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Ind Control Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2015-07-02	WOS:000355946200001

We present a framework that allows for the generation of stereoscopic image pairs with per-pixel control over disparity, based on multi-perspective imaging from light fields. The proposed framework is novel and useful for stereoscopic image processing and post-production. The stereoscopic images are computed as piecewise continuous cuts through a light field, minimizing an energy reflecting prescribed parameters such as depth budget, maximum disparity gradient, desired stereoscopic baseline, and so on. As demonstrated in our results, this technique can be used for efficient and flexible stereoscopic post-processing, such as reducing excessive disparity while preserving perceived depth, or retargeting of already captured scenes to various view settings. Moreover, we generalize our method to multiple cuts, which is highly useful for content creation in the context of multi-view autostereoscopic displays. We present several results on computer-generated content as well as live action content.									33	0	0	0	0	0	44			0730-0301	1557-7368										Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, SwitzerlandDisney Res Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland	Disney Res Zurich			2011-12-01	WOS:000297681100068

Key multiplicity issues in clinical drug development								STATISTICS IN MEDICINE				32	7			1079	1111				10.1002/sim.5642							Article	MAR 30 2013	2013	Much progress has been made over the past decade with the development of novel methods for addressing increasingly more complex multiplicity problems arising in confirmatory Phase III clinical trials. This includes traditional problems with a single source of multiplicity, for example, analysis of multiple endpoints or doseplacebo contrasts. In addition, more advanced problems with several sources of multiplicity have attracted attention in clinical drug development. These problems include two or more families of objectives such as multiple endpoints evaluated at multiple dose levels or in multiple patient populations. This paper provides a review of concepts that play a central role in defining and solving multiplicity problems (error rate definitions) and introduces main classes of multiple testing procedures widely used in clinical trials (nonparametric, semiparametric, and parametric procedures). The paper also presents recent advances in multiplicity research, including gatekeeping procedures for clinical trials with multiple sets of objectives. The concepts and methods introduced in the paper are illustrated using several case studies on the basis of real clinical trials. Software implementation of commonly used multiple testing and gatekeeping procedures is discussed.

J	Naik, AV; Rogers, JD; Royer, JS; Selman, AL										A hierarchy based on output multiplicity								THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE				207	1			131	157				10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00060-7							Article	OCT 28 1998	1998	The class NPkV consists of those partial, multivalued functions that can be computed by a nondeterministic, polynomial time-bounded transducer that has at most k distinct values on any input. We define the output-multiplicity hierarchy to consist of the collection of classes NPkV, for all positive integers k greater than or equal to 1. In this paper we investigate the strictness of the output-multiplicity hierarchy and establish three main results pertaining to this:1. If for any k > 1, the class NPkV collapses into the class NP(k - 1)V, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to Cr.2. If the converse of the above result is true, then any proof of this converse cannot relativize. We exhibit an oracle relative to which the polynomial hierarchy collapses to P-NP, but th, output-multiplicity hierarchy is strict.3. Relative to a random oracle, the output-multiplicity hierarchy is strict. This result is in contrast to the still open problem of the strictness of the polynomial hierarchy relative to a random oracle.In introducing the technique for the third result we prove a related result of interest: relative to a random oracle UP INP.

It is essential to make optimal reuse of knowledge of customer services across various functional units of the enterprise. On the other hand, it is also important to ensure that the customer service staff can access and be trained up with dynamically updated knowledge that meets the changing business environment of an enterprise in customer services. However, conventional way of customer service management (CSM) is inadequate to achieve the multi-perspective of an enterprise for achieving knowledge acquisition, knowledge diffusion, business automation and business performance measurement so as to drive the continuous improvement of the customer service quality. In this paper, a multi-perspective knowledge-based system (MPKBS) is proposed for CSM. The MPKBS incorporates various artificial intelligence technologies such as case-based reasoning (CBR) and adaptive time-series model which are used for decision analysis, performance measurement and monitoring. A prototype customer service portal has been built based on the MPKBS and implemented successfully in a consultancy business. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Specifically, MPSE computes positions for the points in 3D and provides different views into the data by means of 2D projections (planes) that preserve each of the given distance matrices. We consider two versions of the problem: fixed projections and variable projections. MPSE with fixed projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices defined on the data points, along with the same number of projections and embeds the points in 3D so that the pairwise distances are preserved in the given projections. MPSE with variable projections takes as input a set of pairwise distance matrices and embeds the points in 3D while also computing the appropriate projections that preserve the pairwise distances. The proposed approach can be useful in multiple scenarios: from creating simultaneous embedding of multiple graphs on the same set of vertices, to reconstructing a 3D object from multiple 2D snapshots, to analyzing data from multiple points of view. We provide a functional prototype of MPSE that is based on an adaptive and stochastic generalization of multi-dimensional scaling to multiple distances and multiple variable projections. We provide an extensive quantitative evaluation with datasets of different sizes and using different number of projections, as well as several examples that illustrate the quality of the resulting solutions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1077-2626	1941-0506										Univ Arizona, Dept Comp Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USAUniv Arizona, Dept Math, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA				2021-11-04	WOS:000706330100134	33108286

In this study, we propose LMFormer, a hybrid model based on CNN and Transformer architectures for human pose estimation. To achieve this, we first design a lightweight multi -feature perspective Token Mixer, using a lightweight feature reconstruction strategy to simultaneously aggregate the spatial and channel feature information, thereby enhancing the performance and generalization capabilities of the model. Subsequently, we explore multi -scale information interaction by developing an iterative multi -feature weighting module, coupled with the design of a multi -scale information propagation mechanism incorporated into the skip connections. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the network on benchmark datasets, including COCO, MPII, and CrowdPose, utilizing a multi -scale deep supervision strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LMFormer, with reduced computational complexity, comprehensively captures multi -scale features, resulting in significant performance improvements. Specifically, LMFormer-B achieves an AP score of 65.8 on the COCO val dataset, surpassing MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 by 1.0 and 5.6 points, respectively. Moreover, its parameters are merely 19.8% and 25% of MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2, with corresponding GFLOPs at 43.8% and 50%. We aim to provide new insights into lightweight and efficient feature extraction strategies, as well as efficient Token Mixer designs.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0925-2312	1872-8286										China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Informat & Control Engn, Xuzhou 221116, Peoples R ChinaSuzhou Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Suzhou 234000, Peoples R China	Suzhou Univ			2024-06-21	WOS:001246290200001

Our starting point is a known theorem from automata theory relating the number of states in a minimal multiplicity automaton for a function to the rank of its Hankel matrix. With this theorem in hand, we present a new simple algorithm for learning multiplicity automata with improved time acid query complexity, and we prove the learnability of various concept classes. These include (among others):The class of disjoint DNF, and more generally satisfy-O(1) DNF.The class of polynomials over finite fields.The class of bounded-degree polynomials over infinite fields.The class of XOR of terms.Certain classes of boxes in high dimensions.In addition, we obtain the best query complexity for several classes known to be learnable by other methods such as decision trees and polynomials over GF(2).While multiplicity automata are shown to be useful to prove the learnability of some subclasses of DNF formulae and various other classes, we study the limitations of this method. We prove that this method cannot be used to resolve the learnability of some other open problems such as the learnability of general DNF formulas or even k-term DNF for k = omega(log n) or satisfy-s DNF formulas for s = omega(1). These results are proven by exhibiting functions in the above classes that require multiplicity automata with super-polynomial number of states.									70	0	0	0	0	0	73			0004-5411	1557-735X										Harvard Univ, Div Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAUniv Turin, Turin, ItalyUniv Calgary, Dept Comp Sci, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, CanadaTechnion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, IsraelUniv Aquila, I-67100 Laquila, Italy				2000-05-01	WOS:000087994000004

J	Chen, Yongfeng; Tan, Junpeng; Yang, Zhijing; Shi, Yukai; Qin, Jinghui				Yang, Zhijing/GWU-7251-2022						Unsupervised multi-perspective fusing semantic alignment for cross-modal hashing retrieval								MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS													10.1007/s11042-023-18048-0					JAN 2024		Article; Early Access		2024	Due to its low computational' cost, excellent storage capacity, and efficient retrieval performance, unsupervised deep cross-modal hashing methods have received extensive attention. However, there are still some challenges with existing unsupervised methods: (1) Due to the lack of label semantics, the neighborhood structure information of unimodal and inter-modal instances may not be fully integrated, resulting in ignoring the deep semantic similarity interaction information. (2) Unsupervised hash codes can neither effectively resolve the semantic consistency between the original features of modal instances nor bridge the gap between the heterogeneous modalities of hash codes. To address these issues, we propose a new unsupervised deep cross-modal hash method called Multi-Perspective Fusing Semantic Alignment Hashing (MPFSAH). It mainly includes two aspects. Firstly, to enhance inter-modal communication, a Multi-level Semantic Similarity Interactive Measure (MSSIM) is constructed. By fusing the neighborhood structure of different modalities and increasing the distance between instances within a modality, the semantic interaction similarity can be deeply mined, to obtain discriminative semantic information. Moreover, we also propose a novel Multi-Perspective Semantic Alignment Mechanism (MPSAM). By minimizing the consistency quantization error of elements in the multi-perspective similarity, it learns the inter-modal similarity consistency. MPSAM includes similarity consistency alignment, structural-semantic alignment, and ranking alignment.

These intertwined processes play a key role in the broader topic of sustainable development, which is making its way into different sectors of society. Sustainable development is not only about technology development but involves several business and regulatory decisions that have a fundamental impact on our future society. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) are important enablers in this sustainability transition and the ICT sectors own sustainability role is yet underdefined. To help scholars, industries, and regulators to better structure the complex topic of connecting sustainable development and the ICTs, this paper discusses development of sustainable 6G mobile communications with a multi-perspective approach including environmental, social and economic sustainabilities, business, regulation and technology dimensions, and academia, industry and regulator stakeholder perspectives. The paper presents findings for 6G development from the three identified perspectives. This paper further explores an illustrative case study of spectrum management in 6G, which has a fundamental role in defining the future mobile connectivity market.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0308-5961	1879-3258										Univ Oulu, Infotech Oulu Focus Inst, Oulu, FinlandUniv Oulu, Ctr Wireless Commun, Oulu, FinlandUniv Oulu, Martti Ahtisaari Inst, Oulu Business Sch, Oulu, FinlandNokia, Oulu, Finland	Nokia			2024-03-09	WOS:001170431300001

The causes of multiplicity are investigated and it is shown for distillation columns, when and how multiplicity can be obtained and how it is conncted to design and operation of the separation process. Some of the causes of multiplicity are traced to over-design of staged separation processes and to values of specified variables. It is shown that the number of multiple solutions may be related to the number of stages while the number of acceptable solutions depend on the set of specified variables. Numerical examples covering simple distillation column models and heterogeneous azeotropic distillation operations are presented.

Advanced services, in particular, can facilitate a more service-focused organization and impact customers' business processes significantly. However, approaches to servitization are often discussed solely from the manufacturer's perspective; overlooking the role of other network actors. Adopting a multi-actor perspective, this study investigates manufacturer, intermediary and customer perspectives to identify complementary and competing capabilities within a manufacturer's downstream network, required for advanced services. Interviews were conducted with 24 senior executives in 19 UK-based manufacturers, intermediaries and customers across multiple sectors. The study identified six key business activities, within which advanced services capabilities were grouped. The unique and critical capabilities for advanced services for each actor were identified as follows; manufacturers; the need to balance product and service innovation, developing customer-focused through-life service methodologies and having distinct, yet synergistic product and service cultures; intermediaries, the coordination and integration of third party products/services; customers, co-creating innovation and having processes supporting service outsourcing. The study is unique in highlighting the distinct roles of different actors in the provision of advanced services and shows that they can only be developed and delivered by the combination of complex interconnected capabilities found within a network.

Recently, deep neural networks have been widely adopted for KGE. However, existing methods mainly focus on improving feature interactions through permutation and reshaping embeddings from a translational perspective, often overlooking the rotational interactions between entities and relations. Furthermore, these models tend to treat all relations in the knowledge graph uniformly, neglecting their heterogeneous characteristics. A novel KGE model with a multi-perspective hierarchical relation network (MHRN) is proposed to mitigate the two problems. Specifically, it generates multi-perspective rotation embeddings by leveraging a group equivariant convolutional layer that incorporates both translation and rotation transformations. This approach captures rotational interactions and significantly enhances the expressiveness of the neural network, all without adding extra parameters. Additionally, the hierarchical relation component employs relation-oriented convolutional filters to preserve the diverse characteristics of different relations. The hierarchical mechanism further extends the receptive field, integrating global information while retaining detailed local features during the aggregation process. Experimental results demonstrate that MHRN excels in capturing rotational interactions and preserving relational characteristics. It delivers outstanding performance on seven benchmark datasets, surpassing baseline methods in 2 out of 4 indicators on FB15k-237, and in all 4 indicators on both FB15k and YAGO3-10 datasets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0950-7051	1872-7409										Cent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Elearning, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R ChinaHubei Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430062, Peoples R China				2025-03-12	WOS:001430226700001

Significant challenges remain in revealing the impacts of multifaceted supply chain activities and policies on energy-water nexus. This study develops a multi-perspective input-output model that integrates multi-perspective input-output analysis and factorial analysis for analyzing the energy-water nexus. This model can investigate the multifaceted delineation of sectoral responsibilities regarding energy-water flows and facilitate the generation of appropriate energy-water management policies from multiple perspectives. This model is then applied to Kazakhstan (waterscarce but energy-rich country in Central Asia), and major findings can be obtained: (i) the key sectors consuming energy and water are identified from multiple supply chain perspectives (i.e., intermediate products, final products, and transmission centers), which can facilitate generating multi-policy scenarios; (ii) Kazakhstan is a net importer of embodied energy and water flows, showing that its economic structure is conducive to alleviating the water shortage; (iii) for the sustainability of energy-water nexus, key sectors like "Vegetables, fruit, and nuts" should prioritize production-based policy, while sectors like "Mining", "Heavy manufacturing" and "Service" should prioritize consumption-based policy. The findings disclose the interactive relationship of energy-water nexus in Kazakhstan as well as provide the scientific support for the joint management of water and energy.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2352-5509											Shandong Univ, China Canada Ctr Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, UR SDU, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R ChinaUniv Regina, Fac Engn & Appl Sci, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, CanadaShandong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shandong Key Lab Water Pollut Control & Resource R, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Cont, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China				2024-11-05	WOS:001345208300001

As a dialogue development goes after the intentions of participants, its topic may not remain constant throughout the whole passage. Hence, it is non -trivial to detect and leverage the topic shift in dialogue modeling. Topic modeling, although has been widely studied in plain text, deserves far more utilization in dialogue reading comprehension. This paper proposes to model multi -turn dialogues from a topicaware perspective. This paper starts with a dialogue segmentation algorithm to split a dialogue passage into topic -concentrated fragments in an unsupervised way. Then these fragments are used as topic -aware language processing units in further dialogue comprehension. On one hand, the split segments indict specific topics rather than mixed intentions, thus showing convenience on in -domain topic detection and location. For this task, this paper designs a clustering system with a self -training auto -encoder, and two constructed datasets are built for evaluation. On the other hand, the split segments are an appropriate element of multi -turn dialogue response selection. For this purpose, this paper further presents a novel model, Topic -Aware Dual -Attention Matching (TADAM) Network, which takes topic segments as processing elements and matches response candidates with a dual cross -attention. Empirical studies on three public benchmarks show great improvements over baselines. Our work continues the previous studies on document topic, and brings the dialogue modeling to a novel topic -aware perspective with exhaustive experiments and analyses.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-2312	1872-8286										Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Key Lab Shanghai Educ Commiss Intelligent Interac, Shanghai, Peoples R China				2024-04-12	WOS:001188626300001

Previous approaches usually learn spoofing features from a single perspective, in which only universal cues shared by all attack types are explored. However, such single-perspective-based approaches ignore the differences among various attacks and commonness between certain attacks and bona fides, thus tending to neglect some non-universal cues that contain strong discernibility against certain types. As a result, when dealing with multiple types of attacks, the above approaches may suffer from the uncomprehensive representation of bona fides and spoof faces. In this work, we propose a novel Advanced Multi-Perspective Feature Learning network (AMPFL), in which multiple perspectives are adopted to learn discriminative features, to improve the performance of FAS. Specifically, the proposed network first learns universal cues and several perspective-specific cues from multiple perspectives, then aggregates the above features and further enhances them to perform face anti-spoofing. In this way, AMPFL obtains features that are difficult to be captured by single-perspective-based methods and provides more comprehensive information on bona fides and spoof faces, thus achieving better performance for FAS. Experimental results show that our AMPFL achieves promising results in public databases, and it effectively solves the issues of single-perspective-based approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1551-6857	1551-6865										Beijing Univ Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Key Lab Computat Intelligence & Intellige, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Key Lab Intelligent Informat Proc, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaPengcheng Lab, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R ChinaHenan Inst Sci & Technol, Xinxiang, Henan, Peoples R China	Beijing Key Lab Computat Intelligence & IntelligePengcheng Lab			2023-08-24	WOS:001035785200035

A variety of challenges regarding systems, plant, physical infrastructure, sources and nature of uncertainties, technological in general and more specifically Information and Communication Technologies requirements, cyber security, big data analytics, innovative business models and markets, policy and societal changes, are critically important to ensure enhanced flexibility and higher resilience, as well as reduced costs of an integrated energy system. Integration of individual energy networks into multi-vector entities opens a number of opportunities, but also presents a number of challenges requiring interdisciplinary perspectives and solutions. Considering drivers like societal evolution, climate change and technology advances, this paper describes the most important aspects which have to be taken into account when designing, planning and operating future multi-vector energy networks. For this purpose, the issues addressing future architecture, infrastructure, interdependencies and interactions of energy network infrastructures are elaborated through a novel interdisciplinary perspective. Aspects related to optimal operation of multi-vector energy networks, implementation of novel technologies, jointly with new concepts and algorithms, are extensively discussed. The role of policy, markets and regulation in facilitating multi-vector energy networks is also reported. Last but not least, the aspects of risks and uncertainties, relevant for secure and optimal operation of future multi-vector energy networks are discussed.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0142-0615	1879-3517										Univ Bristol, Beacon House,Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1QU, Avon, EnglandCardiff Univ, Sch Engn, 14 Parade, Cardiff CF243AA, WalesUniv Bath, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, EnglandUniv Manchester, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, Manchester M1 7JP, Lancs, EnglandNewcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, EnglandUniv Leeds, Sch Chem & Proc Engn & Sch Earth & Environm, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, EnglandSkolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Bolshoy Blvd 30,Bld 1, Moscow 121205, Russia				2021-10-25	WOS:000705982400005

By utilizing message passing and multi-head self-attention mechanisms, RoadGNN-S can effectively capture the coupling impacts of multi-perspective alignment elements (i.e., two-dimensional design, 2.5-dimensional driving, and three-dimensional spatial perspectives). The results of driving simulation data show that root mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and R-squared values of RoadGNN-S are superior to those of other classic deep learning algorithms. Then, prior knowledge (i.e., highway geometry supply, driver expectations, and vehicle dynamics) is introduced into RoadGNN-S, and the models' prediction accuracy and transferability are verified by field observation experiments. Compared to the above data-driven models, knowledge-enhanced RoadGNN-S effectively avoids the fundamental errors, improving the R-squared value in predicting passenger cars' and trucks' operating speed by 7.9% and 10.7%, respectively. The findings of this study facilitate the intelligent highway geometric design with multi-perspective fusion and knowledge enhancement techniques.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1093-9687	1467-8667										Tongji Univ, Coll Transportat Engn, Key Lab Rd & Traff Engn, Minist Educ, 4800 Caoan Highway, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R ChinaChalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Gothenburg, SwedenUniv Michigan, Ind & Mfg Syst Engn Dept, Dearborn, MI USAUniv Michigan, Transportat Res Inst, Human Factors Grp, Ann Arbor, MI USA				2024-11-25	WOS:001356851700001

These automata allows one to define functions which compute a number for each tree. They can be seen as a strict generalization of stochastic tree automata since they allow to define functions over any field K. A multiplicity automaton admits a support which is a non deterministic automaton. From a grammatical inference point of view, this paper presents a contribution which is original due to the combination of two important aspects. This is the first time, as far as we now, that a learning method focuses on non deterministic tree automata which computes functions over a field. The algorithm proposed in this paper stands in Angluin's exact model where a learner is allowed to use membership and equivalence queries. We show that this algorithm is polynomial in time in function of the size of the representation.					8th International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference8th International Colloquium on Grammatical Inference	SEP 20-22, 2006SEP 20-22, 2006	Univ Electro Commun; PASCAL Network; Inoue Fdn Sci; Soc Japan, SIG Math Modeling & Problem Solving Informat Proc; New Horizons CompUniv Electro Commun; PASCAL Network; Inoue Fdn Sci; Soc Japan, SIG Math Modeling & Problem Solving Informat Proc; New Horizons Comp	Tokyo, JAPANTokyo, JAPAN	17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0302-9743		3-540-45264-8									Univ Aix Marseille 1, LIF, F-13453 Marseille 13, FranceUniv Alicante, Dep Lenguajes & Sistemas Informat, E-03071 Alicante, Spain				2006-01-01	WOS:000242124200022

This concurrent analysis becomes difficult when data are grouped and split into small multiples for comparison. A design challenge is thus to provide representations that enable multiple perspectives, split into small multiples, to be viewed simultaneously in ways that neither clutter nor overload. We present a design framework that allows us to do this. We claim that multi-perspective comparison across small multiples may be possible by superimposing perspectives on one another rather than juxtaposing those perspectives side-by-side. This approach defies conventional wisdom and likely results in visual and informational clutter. For this reason we propose designs at three levels of abstraction for each perspective. By flexibly varying the abstraction level, certain perspectives can be brought into, or out of, focus. We evaluate our framework through laboratory-style user tests. We find that superimposing, rather than juxtaposing, perspective views has little effect on performance of a low-level comparison task. We reflect on the user study and its design to further identify analysis situations for which our framework may be desirable. Although the user study findings were insufficiently discriminating, we believe our framework opens up a new design space for multi-perspective visual analysis.					18th Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Conference on Visualization18th Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Conference on Visualization	JUN 06-10, 2016JUN 06-10, 2016	Univ Groningen; European Assoc Comp Graph; IEEE Visualizat & Graph Tech CommUniv Groningen; European Assoc Comp Graph; IEEE Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm	Groningen, NETHERLANDSGroningen, NETHERLANDS	10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0167-7055	1467-8659										City Univ London, London, EnglandMiddlesex Univ, London N17 8HR, EnglandPotsdam Univ Appl Sci, Potsdam, Germany	Potsdam Univ Appl Sci			2016-06-01	WOS:000379912300027

In order to be useful along the entire life cycle of software they must provide reliable support and enable automatic management. For that purpose, they must be precise, consistent, correct, and be subject to stringent quality verification and control criteria. Model automation calls for deep formal study of models, so that tools can provide inclusive support to users. This paper deals with optimization of multiplicity constraints in Class Models, i.e., models that provide abstraction on the static structure of software. The paper introduces an in-depth analysis of redundancy of multiplicity constraints, i.e., multiplicities that cannot be realized in any legal instance. The analysis includes: (1) a formal study of gaps of redundancies in multiplicity intervals; (2) algorithmic and rule-based methods for removing redundancies in multiplicity constraints; (3) a formal study of completeness of the algorithmic procedures, with respect to most UML class model constraints. The algorithmic procedures are implemented in our FiniteSatUSE tool. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study of properties of multiplicity redundancy, no completeness analysis of tightening methods, and no systematic study of these features with respect to most UML class model constraints.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1619-1366	1619-1374										Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Comp Sci Dept, Beer Sheva, Israel				2019-08-02	WOS:000475599900014

Words that are ambiguous between unrelated meanings (like bark, which can refer to a tree or to a dog) were accessed more slowly than words that have no unrelated meanings (such as cage). In addition, words that have many related senses (e.g., belt, which can be an article of clothing or, closely related in sense, a fan belt used in machinery) were accessed faster than words that have few related senses (e.g., ant). The findings are inconsistent with accounts that posit that both kinds of ambiguity involve separate lexical entries, but instead offer both behavioral and neurophysiological support for separate entry accounts only for homonymy, and a single-entry model of polysemy. The findings also provide neural correlates for a behavioral study of lexical ambiguity that demonstrated that the frequently reported ambiguity advantage in lexical decision tasks is not due to the presence of many unrelated meanings but to the presence of many related senses.

This formula is an alternating sum over the Weyl group and involves the computation of a partition function. In this paper we consider a q-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity and present a SageMath program to compute q-multiplicities for the simple Lie algebras.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0938-1279	1432-0622										Williams Coll, Dept Math & Stat, Williamstown, MA 01267 USAFlorida Gulf Coast Univ, Dept Math, Ft Myers, FL USA				2018-07-24	WOS:000438254800005

The multiplicity constraints incur a dichotomy with respect to approximation between (0,1)-CIPs whose matrix A contains only zeros and ones and the general case. Let m denote the number of rows of A. The well known O(log m) cost approximation with respect to the optimum of the linear relaxation is valid for general CIPs, but multiplicity constraints can be dealt with effectively only in the (0,1) case. In the general case, existing algorithms that match the integrality gap for the cost objective violate the multiplicity constraints by a multiplicative O(log m) factor. We make progress by defining column-restricted CIPs, a strict superclass of (0,1)-CIPs,. and showing how to find for them integral solutions of cost O(log m) times the LP optimum while violating the multiplicity constraints by a multiplicative O(1) factor.

How to more effectively identify multi-label entities and explore the correlation between labels is the focus of our work. Unlike previous models that are modeled in single-label multi-classification problems, we propose a novel multi-label local metric NER model to rethink Nested Entity Recognition from a multi-label perspective. Simultaneously, to address the significant sample imbalance problem commonly encountered in multi-label scenarios, we introduce a parts-of- speech-based strategy that significantly improves the model's performance on imbalanced datasets. Experiments on nested, multi-label, and flat datasets verify the generalization and superiority of our model, with results surpassing the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) on several multi-label and flat benchmarks. After a series of experimental analyses, we highlight the persistent challenges in the multi-label NER. We are hopeful that the insights derived from our work will not only provide new perspectives on the nested NER landscape but also contribute to the ongoing momentum necessary for advancing research in the field of multi-label NER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0950-7051	1872-7409										Nanjing Audit Univ, Sch Comp Sci, 86 West Yushan Rd, Nanjing 211815, Peoples R China				2024-11-17	WOS:001353065300001

It extends the scope by looking at the other perspectives like time, data and resources by connecting events in the event logs to this process model. These perspectives are not isolated and are all related to each other. For each perspective, there is a different technique, which is dedicated to the relevant perspective, applied and these techniques may need to consume the results of one another in a sequence of process mining analyses. As a result, a holistic process model is created by attaching and binding related attributes of the event logs to the backbone (control flow) of the model. Therefore, representing the holistic model and keeping what is produced from each perspective in a secure and immutable way while applying the multiple perspectives become important. In this study, a BPMN-extended Data Model is proposed to put together the models from the multi-perspective process mining and a tool is developed to keep this data model as an asset into a private blockchain developed by using Hyperledger Fabric. The practical relevance and validity of the approach are shown in the case studies that use real-life data from two different domains.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0218-1940	1793-6403										Hacettepe Univ, Software Engn Res Grp, Ankara, TurkeyHacettepe Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Ankara, Turkey				2022-05-03	WOS:000787086600006

We give a minimisation algorithm that runs in polynomial time assuming unit-cost arithmetic. We also show that a polynomial bound in the standard Turing model would require a breakthrough in the complexity of polynomial identity testing by proving that the latter problem is logspace equivalent to the decision version of minimisation. The developed techniques also improve the state of the art in multiplicity word automata: we give an NC algorithm for minimising multiplicity word automata. Finally, we consider the minimal consistency problem: does there exist an automaton with a given number of states that is consistent with a given finite sample of weight-labelled words or trees? We show that, over both words and trees, this decision problem is interreducible with the problem of deciding the truth of existential first-order sentences over the field of rationals-whose decidability is a longstanding open problem.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1860-5974											Univ Oxford, Oxford, England				2018-01-09	WOS:000418916500002

The covering multiplicity CM(LAMBDA) is the maximal number of times the interiors of these balls overlap. We show that the least possible covering multiplicity for an n-dimensional lattice is n if n less-than-or-equal-to 8, and conjecture that it exceeds n in all other cases. We determine the covering multiplicity of the Leech lattice and of the lattices I(n), A(n), D(n), E(n) and their duals for small values of n. Although it appears that CM(I(n)) = 2n-1 if n less-than-or-equal-to 33, as n --> infinity we have CM(I(n)) approximately 2.089...n. The results have application to numerical integration.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0179-5376	1432-0444										AT&T BELL LABS, MATH SCI RES CTR, MURRAY HILL, NJ 07974 USA				1992-01-01	WOS:A1992JG70200001

To analyze such multi-omics data and explore relationships, reliable bioinformatics systems are much needed. Existing systems are either for exploring curated data or for processing omics data in the form of a library such as IL Thus scientists have much difficulty in investigating relationships among gene expression, DNA sequence variation, and DNA methylation using multi-omics data.In this study, we report a system called BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS for the integrated analysis of DNA methylation, sequence variation (SNPs), and gene expression for distinguishing cellular phenotypes at the pairwise and multiple phenotype levels. The system can be deployed on either the Amazon cloud or a publicly available high-performance computing node, and the data analysis and exploration of the analysis result can be conveniently done using a web-based interface. In order to alleviate analysis complexity, all the process are fully automated, and graphical workflow system is integrated to represent real-time analysis progression. The BioVLAB-mCpG-SNP-EXPRESS system works in three stages. First, it processes and analyzes multi-omics data as input in the form of the raw data, i.e., FastQ files. Second, various integrated analyses such as methylation vs. gene expression and mutation vs. methylation are performed. Finally, the analysis result can be explored in a number of ways through a web interface for the multi-level, multi-perspective exploration. Multi-level interpretation can be done by either gene, gene set, pathway or network level and multi-perspective exploration can be explored from either gene expression, DNA methylation, sequence variation, or their relationship perspective. The utility of the system is demonstrated by performing analysis of phenotypically distinct 30 breast cancer cell line data set.

The multi-layer perspective on the socioeconomic drivers of household-driven carbon emissions downscales the driver analyses from the aggregated level to the level of individual industrial chain paths. This can support refined household mitigation measures at the path level, which has not been well characterized. This study investigated the multi-layer drivers of critical industrial chain paths responsible for the changes of household-driven carbon emissions in China during 2012-2020. The top-ranked industrial chain paths, regarding the total amount, the increment, and the driving effects of household-driven emissions, were identified as critical paths. From the consumption perspective, per capita consumption was the main driver for shorter (0th and 1st layers) paths during 2012-2018. During 2018-2020, per capita consumption and carbon emission intensity were the dominant drivers for urban and rural paths, respectively. From the income perspective, the intermediate output structural effect contributed over 45% of the emissions in longer (than 1st layer) paths during 2012-2018. From 2018 to 2020, the changes in per capita income had the largest impact on the critical paths in each production layer. Furthermore, for a particular industrial chain path, multi-layer drivers could have opposite effects on household-driven emissions across different time periods. These findings demonstrate the importance of the multi-layer perspective in revealing new industrial chain hotspots for carbon reductions at the household level. In the context of China's common prosperity, this study proposed more fine-grained household mitigation measures based on the collaboration among governments, enterprises, and households from both consumption and income perspectives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6526	1879-1786										Guangdong Univ Technol, Guangdong Basic Res Ctr Excellence Ecol Secur & Gr, Sch Ecol Environm & Resources, Key Lab City Cluster Environm Safety & Green Dev,M, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R ChinaHubei Univ Econ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Emiss Trading Syst Coconstr, Sch Low Carbon Econ, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Univ, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R ChinaMacau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Innovat Engn, Macau 999078, Peoples R ChinaHuazhong Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China				2024-07-12	WOS:001263959900001

This lemma motivates the multiplicity codes of Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin [J. ACM, 2014], who showed how to use this lemma to construct high-rate locally-decodable codes. However, the algorithmic results about these codes crucially rely on the fact that the polynomials are evaluated on a vector space and not an arbitrary product set. In this work, we show how to decode multivariate multiplicity codes of large multiplicities in polynomial time over finite product sets (over fields of large characteristic and zero characteristic). Previously such decoding algorithms were not known even for a positive fraction of errors. In contrast, our work goes all the way to the distance of the code and in particular exceeds both the unique-decoding bound and the Johnson radius. For errors exceeding the Johnson radius, even combinatorial list-decodablity of these codes was not known. Our algorithm is an application of the classical polynomial method directly to the multivariate setting. In particular, we do not rely on a reduction from the multivariate to the univariate case as is typical of many of the existing results on decoding codes based on multivariate polynomials. However, a vanilla application of the polynomial method in the multivariate setting does not yield a polynomial upper bound on the list size. We obtain a polynomial bound on the list size by taking an alternative view of multivariate multiplicity codes. In this view, we glue all the partial derivatives of the same order together using a fresh set z of variables. We then apply the polynomial method by viewing this as a problem over the field F(z) of rational functions in z .									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9448	1557-9654										Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Mumbai 400005, IndiaSimons Inst Theory Comp, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAToyota Technol Inst Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USAIndian Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Mumbai 400076, IndiaTata Inst Fundamental Res, Mumbai 400005, IndiaHarvard Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA	Simons Inst Theory Comp			2024-02-04	WOS:001134299300014

The Plurality problem has exactly the same setting while the goal is to find a ball of the dominant color (i.e., a color that occurs most often). Previous literature regarding this topic dealt mainly with adaptive strategies, whereas in this paper we focus more on the oblivious (i.e., non-adaptive) strategies. Given that our strategies are oblivious, we establish a linear upper bound for the Majority problem with arbitrarily many different colors assuming a majority label exists. We then show that the Plurality problem is significantly more difficult by establishing quadratic lower and upper bounds.

Many of these rely on sharing 'folksonomies', personal descriptions of information and objects for one's own retrieval. Such applications involve many feedback mechanisms via the community, and have been shown to have emergent properties of complex dynamic systems. We propose that such dynamically evolving information domains can be more usefully described by means of a soft ontology, a dynamically flexible and inherently spatial metadata approach for ill-defined domains. Our contribution is (1) the elaboration of the so far intuitive concept of soft ontology in a way that supports conceptualizing dynamically evolving domains. Further, our approach proposes (2) a whole new mode of interaction with information domains by means of recurring exploration of an information domain from multiple perspectives in search of more comprehensive understanding of it, i.e. multi-perspective exploration. We demonstrate this concept with an example of collaborative tagging in an educational context.									13	0	0	0	1	0	15			0266-4720	1468-0394										Tallinn Univ, KERG Knowledge Environm Res Grp, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia				2008-11-01	WOS:000260256300004

It is shown that the consensus seeking process can be viewed as an iterative learning process for agents under directed networks to improve their performances from time to time in order to achieve consensus. If a desired consensus state is specified, then the multi-agent system can be guaranteed to reach consensus through reducing the tracking error between each agent's state and the desired consensus state monotonically to zero with respect to the increasing of time. If there is no desired consensus state, then the agents can achieve consensus through reducing their states monotonically to the minimum quantity with increasing time. Simulations illustrate the observed results.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1598-6446	2005-4092										Henan Normal Univ, Sch Math & Informat Sci, Henan Engn Lab Big Data Stat Anal & Optimal Contr, Xinxiang 453007, Peoples R ChinaHenan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Math & Informat Sci, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China				2016-10-19	WOS:000384390900003

Most of the existing methods pay little attention to the rapidly changing trajectory information, but how to effectively solve this problem is crucial to ensure pedestrian safety. The Gabor transform has inherent advantages for capturing instantaneously changing information. Therefore, for the first time, we introduce the Gabor transformation idea into pedestrian trajectory prediction and propose the Multi-scale Learnable Gabor Transform Network (MlgtNet), which establishes global and local contextual relationships from multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspectives. The network first uses the Multi-scale Feature Dimension Enhancement Module (MFDEM) ascending dimension trajectory sequence, and uses the Multi-scale Gabor Convolution Module (MGCM) to guide the model to establish the dependence of different distances from different dimensions to model the interrelationship between global/local features at different scales and different step sizes. Finally, the Feature Fusion Module (FFM) processes the multimodal information and fuses it with the multi-scale trajectory features to obtain the trajectory prediction representation in different visual fields. The representation results are then used for secondary fusion to obtain the global prediction results. Experimental results show that MlgtNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with its lightweight model size on the vast majority of widely used trajectory prediction datasets from different perspectives.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1524-9050	1558-0016										Northeastern Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China				2024-07-26	WOS:001271447100001

The Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin developed the most widely used visual method to assess bunch compactness from loose (1) to tight (9). This method, however, requires training and relies on manual measurements and is, thus, subject to bias and error. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of multi-perspective imaging analysis combined with multivariate modelling to predict grape bunch compactness. Such a method has the potential to be rapid, automated and objective.Methods and ResultsVitis labruscana cv. Kyoto grape bunches were collected from three vineyards over two consecutive seasons and imaged with a multi-perspective imaging system, which sensed mass and imaged the surface of the bunch from three perspectives using mirror reflection. Bulk density of the grape bunch was linearly related to compactness (correlation coefficient 0.679). The morphological features of grape bunches and their derivative variables were digitised using 23 image processing descriptors and were regressed with the measured compactness using multivariate data analysis, including partial least squares, multiple linear regression and principal component regression. The partial least squares model was the best performed, predicting bunch compactness with a correlation coefficient of prediction (r(p)) of 0.8481 as well as root mean squared error of prediction of 1.2287.ConclusionsMulti-perspective imaging combined with image processing and multivariate data analysis can assess the compactness of grape bunches.Significance of the StudyThe performance of this multi-perspective imaging method could be developed to automate the postharvest assessment of the compactness of grape bunches.									16	1	0	0	7	0	17			1322-7130	1755-0238										Wenzhou Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn Informat, Wenzhou City 325035, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaJiangsu Univ, Sch Food & Biol Engn, Zhenjiang City 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2018-12-28	WOS:000443380800003

Since CSCW involves different organizations, it can be seen as a social model. From this point of view, we investigate the possibility of modelling CSCW by agent technology, and then based on organizational semiotics method a multi-agent architecture is proposed via using EDA agent model.

Two kinds of 3D LAMP representations are proposed: the relief-like LAMP and the image-based LAMP. Both types of LAMPs concisely represent almost all the information from a long image sequence. Methods to construct LAMP representations from video sequences with dominant translation are provided. The relief-like LAMP is basically a single extended multi-perspective panoramic view image. Each pixel has a pair of texture and depth values, but each pixel may also have multiple pairs of texture-depth values to represent occlusion in layers, in addition to adaptive resolution changing with depth. The image-based LAMP, on the other hand, consists of a set of multi-perspective layers, each of which has a pair of 2D texture and depth maps, but with adaptive time-sampling scales depending on depths of scene points. Several examples of 3D LAMP construction for real image sequences are given. The 3D LAMP is a concise and powerful representation for image-based rendering. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

However, several challenges remain: (1) most methods are designed for static or discrete-time dynamic graphs; (2) existing continuous-time dynamic graph algorithms focus on a single evolving perspective; and (3) many continuous-time dynamic graph approaches necessitate numerous temporal neighbors to capture long-term dependencies. In response, this paper introduces a Multi-Perspective Feedback-Attention Coupling (MPFA) model. MPFA incorporates information from both evolving and original perspectives to effectively learn the complex dynamics of dynamic graph evolution processes. The evolving perspective considers the current state of historical interaction events of nodes and uses a temporal attention module to aggregate current state information. This perspective also makes it possible to capture long-term dependencies of nodes using a small number of temporal neighbors. Meanwhile, the original perspective utilizes a feedback attention module with growth characteristic coefficients to aggregate the original state information of node interactions. Experimental results on one dataset organized by ourselves and seven public datasets validate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our proposed model.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2632-2153										Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Caoan Rd 4800, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R ChinaNaval Med Univ, Mil Med Univ 2, Sch Anesthesiol, Dept Clin Anesthesiol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R ChinaNingxia Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Elect Engn, 217 Wencui St North, Yinchuan 750021, Ningxia Hui, Peoples R China				2024-08-11	WOS:001283702500001

Prior to the election, each voter receives a private signal corresponding to the candidate the voter thinks is best. Voters are relatively more likely to think a given candidate is best if the candidate is a relatively better candidate. I show that there is a sequence of equilibrium strategies for the voters such that, as the number of voters goes to infinity, the probability that the best candidate is elected goes to 1. I further show that all candidates receive significant vote shares in any equilibrium in which information fully aggregates under plurality rule and that voters do at least as well when the election is decided by a runoff as they do when the election is decided by plurality rule.

J	LINK, G; SCHUTZE, H										THE TREATMENT OF PLURALITY IN (L)LILOG								LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				546				242	352											Article	1991	1991	This paper summarizes research concerning the incorporation of plural constructions into the LILOG text understanding system. The treatment of plurality is based on the first order system LP, first presented in [Link 1983]. The paper consists of two parts. After a very short review of the system LP, a translation is given from a version of LILOG's discourse representation language L(Dis), containing plural constructions, into the formal language L(LILOG), which, in turn, is extended by LP. This shows how it is possible for LILOG's inference machine, modified along the lines indicated, to deal with pluralic bits of knowledge that are realistic representations of a wide array of plural constructions in language. Since in the field of plural phenomena there seems to be some danger of proliferation of readings, particular emphasis has been laid on questions of vagueness and ambiguity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0														STANFORD UNIV,CSLI,STANFORD,CA 94305				1991-01-01	WOS:A1991KV08500023

In this work, we investigate the first step, with the aim of reducing the complexity of multiplicity calculation. It is observed that the objective value of multiplicity calculation in Koetter and Vardy's (KV) algorithm can be expressed as an increasing function of independent parameter. Based on this fact, we propose to use bisection or golden section methods in multiplicity calculation. Simulation study demonstrates that our proposed approach can significantly reduce the computational complexity of RS codes decoding.

Today's highly complex business and technological environments and the need to effectively communicate and justify IT security requirements and controls demand methodical support. The modeling method presented in this paper addresses this demand. The method is based on the assumption that enriched enterprise models integrating technological, business, organizational and strategic aspects provide an effective foundation for developing and managing IT security systems and facilitating communication and understanding between stakeholders. The proposed modeling method for designing and managing IT security in organizations accounts for different perspectives and is based on multi-perspective enterprise modeling. The core components of the method, based on analysis of requirements at different levels of abstraction, are: modeling language concepts specifically designed to address security issues, process models that guide the use of the resulting language, and a modeling environment. The method facilitates elaborate representations of the various aspects of IT security at different levels of abstraction and covers the entire lifecycle of IT security systems. It not only supports multi-perspective requirement analysis and design but also enables monitoring and analysis of IT security at runtime. The presented artifact is evaluated with recourse to a research method that enables the configuration of multi-criteria justification procedures.									16	0	0	0	0	0	23			1617-9846	1617-9854										Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Ind & Management Engn, POB 653, IL-8410501 Beer Sheva, IsraelUniv Duisburg Essen, Inst Comp Sci & Business Informat Syst, Univ Str 9, D-45141 Essen, Germany				2016-06-01	WOS:000374687100005

Its effect on energy saving and emission reduction is prominent. The application of lightweight material is commonly adopted as a primary way of weight reduction. However, material selection is often subject to multi-perspective performance characteristics, e.g., mechanical and societal properties, and therefore, an effective multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method is needed. This paper presents a systematic hierarchical structure of multi-perspective indices for optimal lightweight material selection, including mechanical, durability, societal, and technical properties. A hybrid evaluation approach (G-TOPSIS) integrating grey relation analysis and technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is applied to evaluate lightweight material alternatives and obtain an optimal one. A case study, i.e., 17 kinds of lightweight materials, is conducted to verify the hierarchical structure and the MCDM method. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to monitor the robustness of solution ranking to changes. The results show that this method provides an effective decision-making tool for optimal lightweight material selection for automobile applications.									38	2	0	0	0	0	40			2169-3536											Jilin Univ, State Key Lab Automot Simulat & Control, Changchun 130022, Jilin, Peoples R China				2018-04-10	WOS:000427469400011

An extensive analysis of requirements for enterprise modeling serves to motivate and assess the method. The method is based on an elaborate conception of multi-perspective enterprise models and on an extensible language architecture. The language architecture is comprised of a meta modeling language and an extensible set of integrated domain-specific modeling languages (DSML). The DSML are supplemented with process models and with guidelines for their reflective use. The corresponding modeling environment integrates editors for various DSML into multi-language model editors. It includes a meta model editor which enables the convenient use, development and extension of the set of supported DSML and supports the generation of respective graphical model editors. Thus, it also serves as a foundation for method engineering. MEMO covers both software engineering as well as social, managerial and economic aspects of the firm. The presentation of MEMO is supplemented with a comparative overview of other approaches to enterprise modeling. The paper concludes bys summarizing fundamental technical, epistemological and political challenges for enterprise modeling research and discusses potential paths for future research.									119	0	0	0	2	0	122			1619-1366	1619-1374										Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Comp Sci & Business Informat Syst ICB, Informat Syst & Enterprise Modelling Res Grp, Essen, Germany				2014-07-30	WOS:000338502600003

Unlike current dual-perspective cheating behavior detection methods, we expand the monitoring field of view by using three cameras with different perspectives: the overhead perspective, the horizontal perspective, and the face perspective. This effectively covers areas where cheating may occur. An adaptive cheating behavior detection system based on three perspectives is proposed, including a gaze direction recognition model based on Swin Transformer, a cheating tool detection model based on Lightweight-YOLOv5-Coordinate Attention, and a cheating behavior determination model based on Multilayer Perceptron. To reduce computational complexity and ensure efficient processing while expanding the monitoring field of view, the system uses the results of the gaze direction recognition model to adaptively select the cheating behavior detection model from different perspectives, reducing the three-perspective system to dual-perspective. In online simulation tests, our method achieves cheating behavior determination at 35 frames per second, with an average recognition rate of 95%. It has good real-time performance, accuracy, and a large monitoring range.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2076-3417										Nantong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Nantong 226019, Peoples R ChinaNantong Univ, Sch Educ Sci, Nantong 226019, Peoples R ChinaNantong Univ, Sch Transportat & Civil Engn, Nantong 226019, Peoples R China				2024-06-03	WOS:001233114900001

This differs from the type of description used by standard scheduling problems, which assume that all parts or jobs are unique. In high-multiplicity scheduling problems, identical jobs are encoded in an efficient format similar to that of the production shop. The input describes one of the jobs and the number of such identicaljobs. We consider single-machine, high-multiplicity problems with earliness and tardiness weights. We investigate three categories of weights: unit, common, and job-specific. For the unit and common weights problems, a polynomial time algorithm is developed. The algorithm takes advantage of identicaljobs and finds solutions faster than by standard methods.We provide a new method for creating a lower bound for the standard encoding of the job-specific weights problem, which is NP-complete. We disaggregate each job into identical sub jobs with unit processing times. Then, using high-multiplicity encoding for this disaggregated problem, we create a lower bound on the optimal objective function value of the original problem in polynomial time. Heuristic solutions are generated using a randomized rounding technique on the lower bound solution. These results are used in a branch-and-bound solution method. Analytical and computational results are presented. Our combination of disaggregation and high-multiplicity encoding provides a new method for creating lower bounds on the objective functions of NP-complete problems.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0030-364X											Ctr Naval Anal, Alexandria, VA 22302 USAOhio State Univ, Dept Ind Welding & Syst Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA				2000-09-01	WOS:000165143900011

However, challenges remain in selecting predictive models and effectively utilizing historical solutions. In this paper, we propose a multiple perspective dual-layer collaborative prediction strategy to efficiently tackle both challenges. The multi-perspective approach is further divided into a search perspective and a spatial perspective and realized through the collaboration of three sub-strategies. From the search perspective, we employ a dual-layer prediction strategy that focuses on both global and local information. Specifically, the first layer utilizes Gaussian process regression (GPR) to predict centrality, which serves as a measure of the population's collective intelligence. This layer effectively captures global insights into population dynamics, identifying overarching movement trends over time. Building on these global insights, the second layer employs a knee-point interval partitioning strategy that combines vector partitioning with knee-point-based predictions. This layer provides localized insights that complement the broader movement trends identified by the first layer. From the spatial perspective, we implement dual- layer historical similarity detection across non-dominated solutions in both decision and objective spaces. Specifically, the historical Pareto-similarity selection strategy identifies populations in these spaces that demonstrate the greatest similarity to the current population's non-dominated solutions. The spatial perspective complements the search perspective, forming a coherent framework that systematically integrates global, local, and historical information. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs better than previous state-of-the-art methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2210-6502	2210-6510										Xiangtan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R ChinaHunan Inst Engn, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China				2025-03-14	WOS:001440518000001

Similarly, identical machines are efficiently encoded in the same manner. We investigate parallel-machine, high-multiplicity problems. where there are three possible machine speed structures: identical, proportional, or unrelated. For the objectives of minimizing the sum of job completion limes and minimizing the makespan, we consider both nonpreemptive and preemptive problems. Fur some problems, we develop polynomial time algorithms. For several problems, we demonstrate that the recognition versions can be solved in polynomial time, while the optimization versions require pseudo polynomial time. We also show that changing from standard binary encoding to high-multiplicity encoding does not affect the complexity class of NP-complete problems.									16	0	0	0	0	0	17			0025-5610	1436-4646										Ctr Naval Anal, Alexandria, VA 22311 USAOhio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA				2001-02-01	WOS:000167033000002

We formalize and generalize the idea of "partial derivatives" introduced in 1995 by Antimirov, in order to obtain a construction of an automaton with multiplicity from a rational expression describing a formal power series with coefficients in a semiring.We first define precisely what is such a rational expression with multiplicity and which hypothesis should be put on the semiring of coefficients in order to keep the usual identities.We then define the derivative of such a rational expression as a linear combination of expressions called derived terms and we show that all derivatives of a given expression are generated by a finite set of derived terms, that yields a finite automaton with multiplicity who se behaviour is the series denoted by the expression. We also prove that this automaton is a quotient of the standard (or Glushkov) automaton of the expression. Finally, we propose and discuss some possible modifications to our definition of derivation.

J	Wang, Di; Ni, Qingjian										A domain-aware model with multi-perspective contrastive learning for natural language understanding								APPLIED INTELLIGENCE				55	3					218			10.1007/s10489-024-06154-x							Article	FEB 2025	2025	Intent detection and slot filling are core tasks in natural language understanding (NLU) for task-oriented dialogue systems. However, current models face challenges with numerous intent categories, slot types, and domain classifications, alongside a shortage of well-annotated datasets, particularly in Chinese. Therefore, we propose a domain-aware model with multi-perspective, multi-positive contrastive learning. First, we adopt a self-supervised contrastive learning with multiple perspectives and multiple positive instances, which is capable of spacing the vectors of positive and negative instances from the domain, intent, and slot perspectives, and fusing more positive instance information to increase the classification effectiveness of the model. Our proposed domain-aware model defines domain-level units at the decoding layer, allowing the model to predict intent and slot information based on domain features, which greatly reduces the search space for intent and slot. In addition, we design a dual-stage attention mechanism for capturing implicitly shared information between intents and slots. We propose a data augmentation method that adds noise to the embedding layer, applies fine-grained augmentation techniques, and filters biased samples based on a similarity threshold. Our model is applied to real task-oriented dialogue systems and compared with other NLU models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other models in terms of NLU performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-669X	1573-7497										Southeast Univ, Coll Software Engn, Nanjing 211189, Peoples R ChinaSoutheast Univ, Key Lab New Generat Artificial Intelligence Techno, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China				2024-12-29	WOS:001382892700004

Current deep learning-based methods for identifying suppressive jamming signals suffer from reduced effectiveness with limited training samples and issues related to high parameter counts and computational complexity. To address these challenges, the authors propose a jamming recognition method based on an efficient multi-perspective jamming feature perception network. This method extracts features from the time-frequency spectrum of jamming signals from multiple perspectives, including local, multi-scale, cross-space, and global, to obtain more robust and discriminative jamming features and improve recognition under limited training sample conditions. Additionally, the authors design efficient modules for local jamming feature extraction, multi-scale jamming feature down-sampling, and global jamming feature representation. The lightweight design of these modules enables the proposed method to maintain excellent jamming recognition performance while reducing parameters and computational complexity. Simulation experiment outcomes highlight the exceptional effectiveness of the proposed technique across multiple metrics compared to eight other approaches. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits significantly fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than its deep learning-based counterparts.The authors propose a jamming recognition method based on an efficient multi-perspective jamming feature perception network.

The issue of multiplicity in noninferiority studies								CLINICAL TRIALS				9	6			730	735				10.1177/1740774512455370							Article; Proceedings Paper	DEC 2012	2012	Background In a clinical study to evaluate noninferiority (NI) of an experimental drug relative to an established therapy, it is common to further test superiority of the experimental drug after NI is established. It has been shown that no multiplicity issue exists between NI and superiority tests of the primary endpoint. However, when there is an additional, or secondary, endpoint that will be tested for superiority in a hierarchical fashion to the NI testing of the primary endpoint, it is not clear whether the overall type I error rate is strictly controlled among all the tests.Purpose In this article, our goal is to evaluate if the family-wise type I error rate is strictly controlled in this setting. We also evaluate a multiplicity adjustment procedure based on the Hochberg procedure.Methods We use the closed testing principle to evaluate the family-wise type I error rate. Some simulations are performed to appreciate the magnitude of the potential inflation of the type I error rate.Results It is demonstrated that the family-wise type I error rate is not controlled and an appropriate multiplicity adjustment procedure must take into account the NI and superiority tests of the two endpoints. When the test statistic used for superiority testing of the primary endpoint is the same as that for the NI testing, a multiplicity adjustment method using the popular Hochberg procedure is shown to be potentially conservative.Limitation The assessment is based on a simplified set-up where there is only one secondary endpoint tested for superiority in addition to the primary endpoint.Conclusion It is necessary to evaluate the issue of multiplicity in non-inferiority studies to assure strict control of the family-wise type I error rate.

The new perspective considers the final ensemble classifier model as a static state, which can be estimated using a Kalman filter that combines noisy estimates made by individual classifier models. A new algorithm based on this perspective, the Kalman Filter-based Heuristic Ensemble (KFHE), is also presented in this paper which shows the practical applicability of the new perspective. Experiments performed on 30 datasets compare KFHE with state-of-the-art multi-class ensemble classification algorithms and show the potential and effectiveness of the new perspective and algorithm. Existing ensemble approaches trade off classification accuracy against robustness to class label noise, but KFHE is shown to be significantly better or at least as good as the state-of-the-art algorithms for datasets both with and without class label noise.

These codes allow for the design of high-rate codes that can recover every codeword or information symbol from many disjoint sets. Recently, the underlying approaches have been combined for the bi-variate case to construct lifted multiplicity codes, a generalization of lifted codes that can offer further rate improvements. We continue the study of these codes by first establishing new lower bounds on the rate of lifted Reed-Solomon codes for any number of variables m, which improve upon the known bounds for any m >= 4. Next, we use these results to provide lower bounds on the rate and distance of lifted multiplicity codes obtained from polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables, which improve upon the known results for any m >= 3. Specifically, we investigate a subcode of a lifted multiplicity code formed by the linear span of m-variate monomials whose restriction to an arbitrary line in F-q(m) is equivalent to a low-degree univariate polynomial. We find the tight asymptotic behavior of the fraction of such monomials when the number of variables m is fixed and the alphabet size q = 2l is large. Using these results, we give a new explicit construction of batch codes utilizing lifted Reed-Solomon codes. For some parameter regimes, these codes have a better trade-off between parameters than previously known batch codes. Further, we show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and the number of disjoint recovering sets for every codeword or information symbol than previously known constructions, thereby providing the best known PIR codes for some parameter regimes. Additionally, we present a new local self-correction algorithm for lifted multiplicity codes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0018-9448	1557-9654										Tech Univ Munich, Inst Commun Engn, D-80333 Munich, GermanyRussian Acad Sci, Inst Informat Transmiss Problems, Moscow 119991, RussiaSkolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Computat & Data Intens Sci & Engn, Moscow 121205, RussiaTechnion Israel Inst Technol, Comp Sci Dept, IL-3200003 Haifa, Israel				2021-11-27	WOS:000720518300029

However, current algorithms rely on pre -trained image similarity models or iteratively updating the image classification models to generate pseudo labels for unknown labels. Thus, they depend on a certain amount of annotations and inevitably suffer from obvious performance drops. To address this dilemma, we propose a dual -perspective semantic -aware representation blending (DSRB) framework that blends multi -granularity category -specific semantic representation across different images, from an instance and prototype perspective, respectively, to transfer information of known labels to complement unknown labels. Specifically, an instance -perspective representation blending (IPRB) module is designed to blend the representations of the known labels in an image with the representations of the corresponding unknown labels in another image to complement these unknown labels. Meanwhile, a prototype -perspective representation blending (PPRB) module is introduced to learn more stable representation prototypes for each category and blends the representation of unknown labels with the prototypes of corresponding labels in a location -sensitive manner to complement these unknown labels. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that the proposed DSRB consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms on all known label proportion settings.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4174	1873-6793										Sun Yat sen Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaGuangdong Univ Technol, Sch Informat Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China				2024-04-19	WOS:001203170300001

However, current KGE models often struggle with the polysemy issue, where entities exhibit different semantic characteristics depending on the relations in which they participate. Such limitation stems from weak interactions between entities and their relation contexts, leading to low expressiveness in modeling complex structures and resulting in inaccurate predictions. To address this, we propose Contextualized Quaternion Embedding (ConQuatE), a model that enhances the representation learning of entities across multiple semantic dimensions by leveraging quaternion rotation to capture diverse relational contexts. In specific, ConQuatE incorporates contextual cues from various connected relations to enrich the original entity representations. Notably, this is achieved through efficient vector transformations in quaternion space, without any extra information required other than original triples. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models for Link Prediction on four widely recognized datasets: FB15k-237, WN18RR, FB15k, and WN18.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2375-4699	2375-4702										Anhui Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Univ, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China				2025-04-30	WOS:001472600200009

Societal functions are fulfilled by sociotechnical systems, which consist of a cluster of aligned elements, e.g., artifacts, knowledge, markets, regulation, cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks and supply networks. Transitions are conceptualised as system innovations, i.e., a change from one sociotechnical system to another. The article describes a co-evolutionary multi-level perspective to understand how system innovations come about through the interplay between technology and society. The article makes a new step as it further refines the multi-level perspective by distinguishing characteristic patterns: (a) two transition routes, (b) fit-stretch pattern, and (c) patterns in breakthrough.

However, existing methods face significant challenges, including the lack of texture structure across various target sizes, the absence of location awareness information, and the weak gray-scale energy distribution of targets, which hinder precise segmentation. To overcome these problems, we introduce the Visual Attention-Guided Multi-Perspective Learning and Location-Aware Network (ViAMLN), which is founded on the principle of multi-perspective feature coupling. ViAMLN is designed to mimic the human visual system by observing feature tensors from multiple perspectives (the front, side, and top views). The Residual Visual Attention Mechanism (RVAM) module is central to ViAMLN. By dynamically learning multi-perspective features, RVAM enhances location awareness capability and achieves comprehensive target characteristic representation. Furthermore, the Poly Kernel Visual Encoding (PKVE) module, incorporating the RVAM module, utilizes poly kernel parallel convolution to expand the receptive field, efficiently capturing shape, texture, and positional features across diverse target sizes. The Full-Scale Visual Decoding (FSVD) module aggregates full-scale feature tensors and then employs the RVAM module to refine feature representation and reduce false alarms by adaptively learning from cross-scale features. Experiments on the IRSTD-1k, NUDT-SIRST, and SIRST datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods. These results validate the effectiveness of ViAMLN in enhancing segmentation accuracy and reducing false alarms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-3203	1873-5142										Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Automat, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China				2025-06-26	WOS:001509652400001

However, these transformations usually omit constraints of the binary association multiplicities, especially the source class optionality constraint.This paper is an extended version of the paper 'Transformation of Special Multiplicity Constraints - Comparison of Possible Realizations' presented at MDASD workshop at the FedCSIS 2012 conference. In this paper, we summarize the process of the transformation of a binary association from a PIM into a PSM for relational databases. We suggest several possible realizations of the source class optionality constraint to encourage the automatically transformation and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We also provide experimental comparison of our suggested realizations to the common realization where this constraint is omitted.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1820-0214											Czech Tech Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Prague 16000, Czech RepublicCharles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Prague 11800, Czech RepublicCzech Tech Univ, Fac Elect Engn, Prague 16000, Czech Republic				2013-12-25	WOS:000327912000006

Multiplicity detection refers to the ability to detect that more than one robot can occupy a given position. When the robotic swarm operates synchronously, a well-known result by Cohen and Peleg permits to achieve gathering, provided robots are capable of multiplicity detection. We present a new algorithm for synchronous gathering, that does not assume that robots are capable of multiplicity detection, nor make any other extra assumption. Unlike previous approaches, the correctness of our proof is certified in the model where the protocol is defined, using the Coq proof assistant.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1432-4350	1433-0490										Univ Paris Saclay, Univ Paris Sud, CNRS, LRI, Orsay, FranceENSIIE, Evry, FranceSorbonne Univ, UPMC, LIP6, CNRS 7606, Paris, FranceColl France, Paris, FranceYale Univ, New Haven, CT USAInst Univ France, Paris, FranceUniv Lyon, Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, LIRIS, CNRS,UMR 5205, Lyon, France				2019-04-10	WOS:000462524100003

The concept is studied with different terminology and perspectives, including individual, social, legal and philosophical. If a norm is an expected behaviour in a social setting, then this article considers how it can be determined whether an individual is adhering to this expected behaviour. We call this process monitoring, and again it is a concept known with different terminology in different fields. Monitoring of norms is foundational for processes of accountability, enforcement, regulation and sanctioning. Starting with a broad focus and narrowing to the multi-agent systems literature, this survey addresses four key questions: what is monitoring, what is monitored, who does the monitoring and how the monitoring is accomplished.									12	0	0	0	0	0	13			0269-8889	1469-8005										Univ Utrecht, Utrecht, NetherlandsUniv Bologna, DISI, Bologna, ItalyDelft Univ Technol, Delft, NetherlandsAmer Univ Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon				2019-01-04	WOS:000453422200001

Despite advancements in self-supervised learning and pretrained language models, challenges persist in entity linking, particularly in interpretability and transferability. Moreover, these models need many aligned documents to adapt to emerging entities, which may not be available due to data scarcity. In this work, we propose a novel Demonstrative Self-TrAining fRamework (D-STAR) that leverages multi-perspective thought navigation. D-STAR iteratively optimizes a question generator and an entity retriever by navigating thoughts on a dynamic graph reasoning across multiple perspectives for question generation. The generated question-answer pairs, along with hard negatives shared in the graph, enable adaptation with minimal computational overhead.

Recent studies have tackled various challenges in federated learning, but the joint optimization of communication overhead, learning reliability, and deployment efficiency is still an open problem. To this end, we propose a new scheme named federated learning via plurality vote (FedVote). In each communication round of FedVote, workers transmit binary or ternary weights to the server with low communication overhead. The model parameters are aggregated via weighted voting to enhance the resilience against Byzantine attacks. When deployed for inference, the model with binary or ternary weights is resource-friendly to edge devices. We show that our proposed method can reduce quantization error and converges faster compared with the methods directly quantizing the model updates.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2162-237X	2162-2388										NC State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Raleigh, NC 27695 USAZhejiang Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Elect Engn, Zhejiang Singapore Innovat & AI Joint Res Lab, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Informat Proc Commun & Netwo, Hangzhou 310000, Peoples R China				2023-01-03	WOS:000899911500001	37015530

Firstly, DM code edges are transformed from image into Hough domain in which linear feature is more prominent. We are able to obtain the valid combinations of candidate marginal points after prior rules-based filtering. Then, we design and extract four boundary features of the finder pattern in image domain. Meanwhile, we establish the model of distorted DM code edge distribution in Hough domain and extract the corresponding features. Finally, we merge the multi-features according to the D-S theory and make the final locating based on the fusion result. Compared with traditional methods, the experiments demonstrate the greater robustness and flexibility of our proposed approach to accurately detecting the contaminated Data Matrix coexisted with perspective deformation.									2	2	0	0	0	0	4			1022-4653	2075-5597										Northwestern Polytech Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Contemporary Design & Integrated Mfg Tech, Xian 710072, Peoples R China				2014-08-15	WOS:000339089800022

Plurality voting is one of the most widely used combination strategies. In this paper, we both theoretically and experimentally analyze the performance of a plurality voting based ensemble classifier. Theoretical expressions for system performance are derived as a function of the model parameters: N (number of classifiers), m (number of classes), and p (probability that a single classifier is correct). Experimental results on the human face recognition problem show that the voting strategy can successfully achieve high detection and identification rates, and, simultaneously, low false acceptance rates.									6	2	0	0	1	0	8			1370-4621	1573-773X										Rose Hulman Inst Technol, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Terre Haute, IN 47803 USAUniv Michigan, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Dearborn, MI 48128 USAWayne State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Detroit, MI 48202 USA				2009-04-01	WOS:000264265700003

This 'age of multiplicity' is marked by the notion that only the use of multiple tools, multiple evidence and considering the multiple aspects of function can give us the broad picture that 21st century biology will need to link and alter micro- and macroscopic phenotypes. It might also help us to undo past mistakes by removing errors from our databases and prevent us from producing more. On the downside, multiplicity is often confusing. We therefore systematically review methods and resources for automated protein function prediction, looking at individual (biochemical) and contextual (network) functions, respectively.									93	0	0	0	83	0	103			0167-7799	1879-3096										UCL, Inst Struct & Mol Biol, London WC1E 6BT, England				2009-04-01	WOS:000265136100004	19251332

The acquisition of transferable target -invariant features is crucial for zero -shot stance detection. This work proposes a stance detection technique that can effectively adapt to new unseen targets, and the essence lies in acquiring fine-grained and easy -to -migrate target -invariant features from multiple perspectives as transferable knowledge. Specifically, we first perform data augmentation by masking topic keywords to mitigate the target dependency introduced by topic keywords in the text. Then, to account for the diversity and granularity of the sample features, we leverage instance -wise contrastive learning to extract transferable meta -features from multiple perspectives. The meta -features bridge features migration from known targets to unseen targets by incorporating different viewpoints. Finally, we incorporate an attention mechanism to fuse the multi -perspective transferable features for predicting the stance of previously unseen targets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over competitive baselines across four benchmark datasets.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1566-2535	1872-6305										Shandong Womens Univ, Sch Data & Comp Sci, Jinan 250300, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100018, Peoples R ChinaNatl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha 410073, Hunan, Peoples R China				2024-05-22	WOS:001222728800001

Interaction with these systems is often rather individual and based on personal preferences, leading to conflicts in multi-user situations. In this paper, we aim to develop a perspective on how to design for multi-user interaction with connected lighting systems, based on a better understanding of real-life interpersonal lighting conflicts. In order to understand everyday lighting conflicts, including their causes and resolution strategies, we present two studies. First, we observe real-life lighting conflicts between couples living in single-room apartments. Using probes for data gathering followed by dyadic interviews, we identify the role of agreements on use in conflicts and we identify different types of conflicts ( preference, activity, and attitude conflicts). Next, we take a more disruptive approach based on technology probes, where we provoke lighting conflicts in family living rooms to observe resolution strategies. We find that people try to avoid conflicts at all costs. If there is a risk that others are negatively affected by an adjustment, people rather not interact with the system at all. Based on these insights, we defined a perspective on designing for multi-user interaction that provides the user with the confidence that interactions are socially accepted. This assurance can be given by presenting the user with information leading to awareness about the acceptance of a lighting change by the other users. We advise on what information can be visualized, based on the three conflict types we observed in the study. The combination of a deeper understanding of conflicts and a perspective on multi-user interface design can serve as a starting point to design better multi-user interfaces for domestic connected systems.									19	0	0	0	0	0	20			1617-4909	1617-4917										Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Design, Den Dolech 2, NL-5612 AZ Eindhoven, Netherlands				2017-04-26	WOS:000397871700014

It aims at ranking useful answers above useless answers. Existing works learn respondents' expertise to help estimate qualities of answers. However, in most of these works, the expertise is only learned from the history answers. As a result, structure correlations between question raisers and respondents are usually ignored. Besides, these works lack an efficient way to learn respondent expertise from extensive history answers. To address the limitations, we propose a novel multi-perspective respondent representation learning (MPRR) network. First, our model learns embeddings of raisers and respondents through a heterogeneous information network(HIN) constructed by the answering records in CQA websites. The structure correlations between raisers and respondents are preserved in the learned embeddings. Second, a freezed pre-trained language model is used to learn respondents' expertise from history answer contents more quickly. Then the multi -perspective respondent representations are generated based on their expertise and the embeddings learned in the HIN. At last, the raisers, respondents, questions, and answers are all considered to compute the matching scores. We evaluate our model on three real-world CQA dataset. Experiment results show that MPRR outperforms all baseline mod-els with three ranking metrics on all datasets.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The first is a new deflation method for an isolated singular root. This construction uses a single linear differential form defined from the Jacobian matrix of the input, and defines the deflated system by applying this differential form to the original system. The advantages of this new deflation is that it does not introduce new variables and the increase in the number of equations is linear in each iteration instead of the quadratic increase of previous methods. The second construction gives the coefficients of the so-called inverse system or dual basis, which defines the multiplicity structure at the singular root. We present a system of equations in the original variables plus a relatively small number of new variables that completely deflates the root in one step. We show that the isolated simple solutions of this new system correspond to roots of the original system with given multiplicity structure up to a given order. Both constructions are "exact" in that they permit one to treat all conjugate roots simultaneously and can be used in certification procedures for singular roots and their multiplicity structure with respect to an exact rational polynomial system.

The segmentation precision and delicacy of targets affect the diagnosis accuracy to a great extent. Deep learning-based technology is currently a hot research direction in the field of medical image analysis. Compared with manual labeling, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) can extract valuable deep features that are difficult for humans to identify. However, some existing DCNN methods tend to only focus on extracting deep features and ignore the semantics loss in the process of continuous pooling and convolution. In addition, medical image datasets are characterized by smallscale, mass noise, and imperceptible differences between foreground and background. How to construct sufficient contextual dependency and feature compensation from multiple perspectives to improve the segmentation performance is still faced with great challenges. In this paper, we propose a deep attention network with multiperspective feature compensation, called Multi-Perspective Feature Compensation Network (MPFC-Net), to supplement semantics loss during continuous pooling and convolution as much as possible and establish strong contextual dependency. Merits of MPFC-Net are as follows: (1) Serializing Multi-scale Aggregation Blocks (SMAB) are constructed to extract features with different scale receptive fields, capture semantics loss in convolutions, and enhance the nonlinear fitting capability of the network. (2) Space and Channel Compound Multidimensional Interaction Attention (SCMI Attention) is designed to consider the weights of feature maps of space and channel and build long-term information interactions between different dimensions. (3) MultiPerspective Feature Compensation (MPFC) is proposed to establish dense context interaction and compensate for semantics loss in continuous pooling and convolution. (4) Deep Feature Reuse (DFR) module is adopted to strengthen the propagation and advanced features reuse. We conduct extensive experiments on the 2018 Data Science Bowl (2018DSB), the ISIC-2018 Challenge (ISIC2018), the JSUAH-Cerebellum, and the DRIVE dataset, and the results show that MPFC-Net achieves competitive performance with simultaneous increases in various metrics.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4174	1873-6793										Jiangsu Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Zhenjiang 212100, Peoples R ChinaJiangnan Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Comp Sci, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R China				2024-03-19	WOS:001184233000001

The position of DPs is impacted by the regulations. However, emerging economies often lack the regulatory environment to support DPs. This paper aims to explore the regulatory developments for DPs using the multi-level perspective (MLP).Design/methodology/approachThe paper explores regulatory developments of ride-hailing platforms (RHPs) in India and their impacts. This study uses qualitative interview data from platform representatives, bureaucrats, drivers, experts and policy documents.FindingsRegulatory developments in the ride-hailing space cannot be explained as a linear progression. The static institutional assumptions, especially without considering the multi-actors and multi-levels in policy formulation, do not serve associated actors adequately in different times and spaces. The RHPs regulations must consider the perspective of new RHPs and the support available to them. Non-consideration of short- and long-term perspectives of RHPs may have unequal outcomes for established and new RHPs.Research limitations/implicationsThis research has implications for the digital economy regulatory ecosystem, DPs and implications for policymakers. Though the data from legal documents and qualitative interviews is adequate, transactional data from the RHPs and interviews with judiciary actors would have been insightful.Practical implicationsThe study provides insights into critical aspects of regulatory evolution, governance and regulatory impact on the DPs' ecosystem. The right balance of regulations according to the business models of DPs allows DPs to have space for growth and development of the platform ecosystem.Social implicationsThis research shows the interactions in the digital space and how regulations can impact various actors. A balanced policy can guide the paths of DPs to have equal opportunities.Originality/valueDP regulations have a complex structure. The paper studies regulatory developments of DPs and the impacts of governance and controls on associated players and platform ecosystems.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2398-5038	2398-5046										OP Jindal Global Univ, Jindal Global Business Sch, Sonipat, IndiaIndian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, IndiaIndian Inst Technol Delhi, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India				2024-03-31	WOS:001179904300001

Decision implication serves as a fundamental means of knowledge representation in FCA in the case of decision-making. This paper extends the scope of knowledge discovery within FCA in single domains to the realm of multi-domains, with introducing a framework for knowledge representation and reasoning within correlative data from the perspectives of cross-domain and multi-granularity. Firstly, we delve into the acquisition and modeling of decision knowledge within correlative data, and introduce the concept of multi- granularity decision implication. We then establish multi-granularity decision implication logic to study the completeness, non-redundancy and optimality of multi-granularity decision implications and introduce inference rules with semantical compatibility. Furthermore, we define lattice fusion decision context to seamlessly integrate information within correlative data and construct a multi- granularity decision implication basis (MGDIB) based on lattice fusion decision context. Finally, we conduct an experiment of generating MGDIB based on GroupLens_MovieLens dataset.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-613X	1873-4731										Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Univ, Key Lab Computat Intelligence & Chinese Informat P, Minist Educ, Taiyuan 030006, Shanxi, Peoples R China				2024-08-03	WOS:001278006600001

As a result, the complexity of cooperative behaviors among industrial devices increases rapidly. It becomes more and more difficult for practicing engineers to ensure temporal correctness of cooperative behaviors. At the same time, smart factory has made its way into the domain of safety critical systems, where there is a higher requirement for temporal correctness of cooperative behaviors. Therefore, it faces great challenges for practicing engineers to ensure temporal correctness of cooperative behaviors. Nowadays, some methods have been proposed for analysis of cooperative behaviors. They can use graphic methods and formal methods to create the graphic model and formal model to analyze and ensure the temporal correctness. However, these methods lack the capability of multi-perspective analysis that is exactly necessary for those systems that have a higher requirement for temporal correctness. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-perspective method that can analyze cooperative behaviors from the macroscopic perspective and the microscopic perspective. Comparing to existing methods, it can provide a more thorough analysis for cooperative behaviors. The usage of our method is illustrated by a semiconductor manufacturing scenario.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2169-3536											Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Comp Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaBeihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China				2017-07-14	WOS:000404486900002

The main focus of paper is the analysis of dynamics of manipulation in voting rules like plurality and veto. An important technical issue that arises is manipulation of voting schemes: a voter may be able to improve the outcome (with respect to his own preferences) by reporting his preferences incorrectly. We consider scenarios where voters cannot coordinate their actions, but are allowed to change their vote after observing the current outcome, as is often the case both in offline committees and in online voting. Voters are allowed to change their votes if they can get their desirable results, we have worked on veto and plurality rule with the small number of candidates and voters. We also used different moves for analysing the dynamics of voting system and concluded different results based on different types of moves (both manipulative and non-manipulative). We also defined a new tie breaking rule "Typicographical rule" and according to our observation it works better than the lexicographical rule.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1386-7857	1573-7543										Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women Univ Peshawar, Dept Comp Sci, Peshawar, Pakistan	Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Women Univ Peshawar			2019-12-16	WOS:000499872200185

This introduces potential deadlocks in the evaluation. We study the discriminating power of this calculus over the usual lambda-terms. We prove in particular that the observational equivalence induced by contexts with multiplicities coincides with the equality of Levy-Longo trees associated with lambda-terms.

Thus, the existence of numerous multi -relation entities imposes a tough challenge to the modelling of the knowledge graph. Some recent works represent the property of corresponding entities and relations by generating embeddings. They attempted to identify the missing entities by translation operations or semantic matching. However, the expressiveness of these approaches depends on the entity (relations) embedding. The heterogeneity of entities leads to the difficulty of balancing uniform embedding dimension settings on complex and sparse relational entities, as high -dimensional embedding leads to the overfitting of sparse relational entities, and low -dimensional embedding leads to the underfitting of complex relational entities. We introduce a multi -perspective knowledge graph embedding model with global and interaction features (MGIF) to alleviate these issues. This achieved knowledge transfer from complex relational entities to sparse relational entities through the multi -view features. In particular, to overcome the local limitations of convolution neural networks, the global features shared between entities (relations) and entities (relations) are incorporated in the MGIF. The performance of MGIF is experimentally evaluated on several datasets. The experimental effects demonstrate that MGIF can efficiently model complicated entities and accomplish state-of-the-art complex relationship prediction results on most evaluation metrics.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0020-0255	1872-6291										Wuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R ChinaCent China Normal Univ, Natl Engn Res Ctr Elearning, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R ChinaZTE Corp, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R ChinaHubei Luojia Lab, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China	Hubei Luojia Lab			2024-04-26	WOS:001206209300001

With input multiplicities, the value of the process gain changes as the manipulated variable changes, and beyond a certain input value, the sign of the gain also changes. A conventional PI controller for processes with input multiplicities may give unstable, less economical, or oscillatory responses. In the present work, control problems of a continuous bioreactor exhibiting two input multiplicities in the dilution rate on productivity were experimentally analyzed. A regulatory problem for the evaluation of controllers was taken up, i.e. a step change was made in the feed substrate concentration from 20 to 25 g/l at steady state conduction at lower (0.09386 h(-1)) and higher (0.2278 h(-1)) dilution rates for the same productivity of 2.9 g/l h. The nonlinear PI controller gave a more stable and fast response at both input dilution rates. The linear PI controller designed for a lower input dilution rate was stable, with some oscillations at the lower dilution rate, but the response was unstable at a higher dilution rate due to the input multiplicity behaviour of the process. Thus, nonlinear PI controller performance was found to be superior to that of the linear controller, and earlier reported theoretical results have been validated by the present experimental work.									8	0	0	0	0	0	9			1615-7591	1615-7605										Osmania Univ, Univ Coll Technol, Hyderabad 7, Andhra Pradesh, India				2005-11-01	WOS:000233500300006	16133471

We use agent environment as a general term to denote the medium for agent interaction. Over the last years, the agent environment has been subject of active research. In this paper, we reflect on the role of the agent environment in multi-agent systems from a middleware perspective. Our study yields the following observations: (1) multi-agent system engineers consider distributed middleware (RMI, CORBA, etc.) as the basic platform for developing multi-agent systems, (2) common middleware services (security, persistency, etc.) are only minimally considered in multi-agent systems, (3) domain-specific middleware for multi-agent systems such as communication services and support for stigmergic coordination are typically developed as stand-alone services and as such difficult to compose with other services.From these observations, we derive a number of challenges for research on environments in multi-agent systems: (1) to amplify reuse, application-specific services should be further consolidated into domain-specific services, (2) the problem of integration must be tackled, i.e. horizontal integration among domain-specific services for multi-agent systems, and vertical integration of domain-specific services upwards with the agents, and downwards with the common middleware services and the underlying distributed platform, (3) to support dynamic changing requirements of the system at hand, flexible composition and dynamic adaptation of services must be supported by the agent environment.									11	0	0	0	1	0	13			1574-1702	1875-9076										Katholieke Univ Leuven, DistriNet Labs, Leuven, BelgiumUniv Appl Sci Western Switzerland, Inst Business Informat Syst, Sierre, Switzerland				2009-01-01	WOS:000212584100006

Given an alphabet A and a unary alphabet {x}, a unary output a-tape NFA accepts a subset of A* x {x}*. In [6] Bergadano and Varricchio proved that the behavior of an unknown automaton with multiplicity in a field K (K-automaton) is exactly identifiable when multiplicity and equivalence queries are allowed. In this paper multiplicity automata are used to prove the learnability of unary output 2-tape NFA's. We shall identify the behavior of a unary output 2-tape NFA using an automaton with multiplicity in K-rat<< x >>.

The voters have to reach a decision-a point in X. A choice p is an element of X is called a beta-plurality point for V, if for any other choice q is an element of X it holds that |{v is an element of V | beta center dot d( p, v) <= d(q, v)}| >= |V|/2. In other words, at least half of the voters "prefer" p over q, when an extra factor of beta is taken in favor of p. For beta = 1, this is equivalent to Condorcet winner, which rarely exists. The concept of beta-plurality was suggested by Aronov, de Berg, Gudmundsson, and Horton [TALG 2021] as a relaxation of the Condorcet criterion. Let beta((X,d))* = sup{beta| every finite multiset V in X admits a beta-plurality point}. The parameter beta* determines the amount of relaxation required in order to reach a stable decision. Aronov et al. showed that for the Euclidean plane beta((R2,parallel to center dot parallel to 2))* = root 3/2 and more generally, for d-dimensional Euclidean space, 1/root d <= beta((R2,parallel to center dot parallel to 2))* <= root 3/2 In this paper, we show that 0.557 <= beta((R2,parallel to center dot parallel to 2))* for any dimension d (notice that v/root d < 0.557 for avny d >= 4). In addition, we prove that for every metric space ( X, d) it holds that root 2 - 1 <= beta((X,d))* and show that there exists a metric space for which beta((X,d)) * <= 1/2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0179-5376	1432-0444										Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Ramat Gan, IsraelOpen Univ Israel, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Raanana, Israel				2024-03-06	WOS:001134160200002

As a traditional recommendation technique, collaborative filtering often encounters sparsity and cold start problems in many recommendation scenarios. Therefore, researchers have found that the introduction of side information can solve these problems to a certain extent and improve the performance of recommender systems. The knowledge graph is a heterogeneous graph that contains rich semantic relationships among items. The Multi-Perspective Learning based on Transformer Knowledge Graph Enhanced Recommendation (MPL-TransKR) proposed in this paper uses the knowledge graph as the side information for input and introduces the multi-head self-attention mechanism by reasonably combining the transformer idea. While learning the high-order neighborhood information of the items, the long-distance information between the items is captured, and the weight value is assigned to the user through the attention mechanism to strengthen the user representation to realize user-item multi-perspective learning to enhance the performance of the recommendation model. Through extensive experiments using public datasets, we demonstrated that MPL-TransKR performs well in book and music recommendations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on several metrics.									2	1	0	0	0	0	3			2169-3536											Univ Sci & Technol Liaoning, Sch Comp Sci & Software Engn, Anshan 114051, Peoples R China				2023-08-04	WOS:001033133500001

At present, deep learning methods are widely cited in PBPM research, but no method has been effective in fusing data information into the control flow for multi-perspective process prediction. Therefore, this paper proposes a process prediction method based on the hierarchical BERT and multi-perspective data fusion. Firstly, the first layer BERT network learns the correlations between different category attribute data. Then, the attribute data is integrated into a weighted event-level feature vector and input into the second layer BERT network to learn the impact and priority relationship of each event on future predicted events. Next, the multi-head attention mechanism within the framework is visualized for analysis, helping to understand the decision-making logic of the framework and providing visual predictions. Finally, experimental results show that the predictive accuracy of the framework surpasses the current state-ofthe-art research methods and significantly enhances the predictive performance of BPM.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1546-2218	1546-2226										Anhui Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Big Data, Huainan 232001, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Huainan 232001, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Embedded Syst & Serv Comp, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China				2024-04-05	WOS:001186529000012

The study of wavelets and perfect reconstruction filter banks are known to have roots in traditional filter design techniques. On the other hand, the field of multi-dimensional systems and signal processing has developed a set of tools intrinsic to itself, and has attained a certain level of maturity over the last two decades. We have recently noted a degree of synergy between the two fields of wavelets and multi-dimensional systems. This arises from the fact that many ideas crucial to wavelet design are inherently system theoretic in nature. While there are,many examples of this synergy manifested in recent publications, we provide a flavor of techniques germane to this development by considering a few specific problems in detail. The construction of orthogonal wavelets can be essentially viewed as a circuit and system theoretic problem of design of energy dissipative (passive) filters, the multi-dimensional version of which has very close ties with a classic problem of lumped-distributed passive network synthesis. Groebner basis techniques, matrix completion problems over rings of polynomials or rings of stable rational functions, i.e., Quillen-Suslin (31) type problems are still other examples, which feature in our discussion in an important manner. A number of open problems are also cited. (C) 1998 The Franklin Institute.

However, the idea with multi-perspectives is not totally considered in the existing DTL models, which might cause insufficient characterizing capabilities of the DTL-based fault diagnosis models with acquiring domain invariant features. To this end, a multi-perspective DTL (MPDTL) model including the perspectives of space, channel and sequence is proposed for the bearing fault diagnosis under varying working conditions in this study. Specifically, the proposed MPDTL model consists of three following parts: (1) A feature enhancement network (FENet) is first established to improve the quality of characteristics under the perspectives of space and channel, in which a residual block attention model with the space and channel attention mechanisms is designed to reduce the redundant features and avoid the gradient vanishing. (2) A bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) network is further introduced to extract the high-level discriminative features from the output of FENet under the perspective of sequence. Hence, the sequence-related information contained in the features learned by the FENet will be disclosed via feeding the forward and backward sequences into the BiLSTM. (3) The module of optimization objective is designed to update our model under the constraint of domain adaptation learning and domain shared classifier training. Analytical results of three experimental cases show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing the bearing fault diagnosis under varying working conditions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

At a fixed reflux rate, output multiplicity, with multiple output values for the same reboiler duty, causes the column to drift to an undesirable steady-state under open loop operation. The same is avoided for a fixed reflux ratio policy. Input multiplicity, where multiple input values give the same output, leads to "wrong" control action under feedback control severely compromising control system robustness. A new metric, rangeability, is defined to quantify the severity of input multiplicity in a steady-state input-output (10) relation. Rangeability is used in conjunction with conventional sensitivity analysis for the design of robust control structures for the RD column. Results for the two synthesized control structures show that controlling the most sensitive reactive tray temperature results in poor robustness due to low rangeability causing "wrong" control action for large disturbances. Controlling a reactive tray temperature with acceptable sensitivity but larger rangeability gives better robustness. It is also shown that controlling the difference in the temperature of two suitably chosen reactive trays further improves robustness of both the structures as input multiplicity is avoided. The article brings out the importance of IO relations for control system design and understanding the complex dynamic behavior of RD systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Deep learning-based methods for aircraft detection can obtain promising detection performance with sufficient and labeled samples. However, current public aircraft datasets are mainly from top-down perspective images, lacking multi-perspectives samples, which limits their applicability. Therefore, we construct a multi-perspectives aircraft dataset (MAD), encompassing 10 distinct classes, and making up of 13,205 images and 18,908 instances. Moreover, the imbalanced and similar classes are common issues in aircraft detection. We design an adaptive threshold focal loss (ATFL) function to alleviate the class imbalance through dynamically adjusting the loss weights between different classes. Meanwhile, the dynamic visual center (DVC) module which can effectively capture both local and global information of target is proposed to distinguish the aircraft classes that share similar feature. Finally, we evaluated several state-of-the-art methods on the constructed MAD dataset as baselines for future research.The experimental results verify that the recognition performance of the current state-of-the-art model can be improved after the application of ATFL and DVC.

However, it may not be possible to capture such abnormal events from a limited camera perspective. We present a deep learning framework to analyze the accident events recorded from multiple perspectives. First, we estimate feature similarity in videos recorded from multiple perspectives. We then divided the video samples into high and low feature similarity groups. Next, we extract spatio-temporal features from each group using two-branch DCNNs and fuse them using a rank-based weighted average pooling strategy followed by classification. We present a new road accident video dataset (MP-RAD), where each accident event is synthetically generated and captured from five independent camera perspectives using a computer gaming platform. Most of the existing road accident datasets use egocentric views or they are captured in fixed camera setups. However, our dataset is large and multi-perspective that can be used to validate ITS-related tasks such as accident detection, accident localization, traffic monitoring, etc. The dataset contains 400 accident events with a total of 2000 videos. We provide temporal annotations of all videos. The proposed framework and the dataset have been cross-validated with latest accident detection baselines trained on real-world road accident videos and vice-versa.

The processes used are the following: classical sequence with two columns, thermally coupled sequence with prefractionator and thermally coupled sequence with a side rectifier. In each sequence analyzed was possible to calculate input multiplicities when the global products purities for ethanol and water are specified variables. The work focuses on the search of a specifications set where the solution of the model equations is unique. It was found that if the degrees of freedom are used to completely specify the separation in the extractive distillation column then there are not input multiplicities. There are no previous reports related with multiplicities for the system ethanol-water-ethyleneglycol. This work enriches the knowledge of this system and contributes with a new concept to calculate the minimum energy consumption without multiplicities. Results are also applicable to extractive distillation processes with dividing wall columns (DWC) because the analyzed thermally coupled sequences are used to represent processes with DWC. Calculations were carried out in the Aspen Plus V10 (R) simulator using RADFRAC modules with the equilibrium stage model to represent distillation units.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0255-2701	1873-3204										Fdn Univ Amer, Grp Proc Separat Convenc, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Avda Circunvalar 20-53, Bogota, ColombiaUniv Nacl Colombia, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, Grp Proc Quim & Bioquim, Carrera 45 26-85, Bogota, Colombia	Fdn Univ Amer			2022-05-19	WOS:000792878900005

The system is an isothermal CSTR with a nonideal mixing represented by a Cholette's model and with a chemical reaction rate k(1)c/(1 + k(2)c)(2). The system exhibits input multiplicities in the feed concentration and also output multiplicities in the reactor exit concentration. For control system design the nonlinear system is represented by a nonlinear gain cascaded with a linear dynamical system. The performance of an integral controller designed for the overall linear system is compared with that of a nonlinear integral controller. The nonlinear integral controller does not have the problem of moving the input to a different level for a square pulse disturbance.									15	0	0	0	0	2	15			0098-1354															1996-03-01	WOS:A1996TN29200005

It is therefore necessary for these administrations to provide quality information that the media can use as sources for their news stories. At the same time, these media outlets have to compare and report while taking into account the plurality of their audiences. However, in local settings, collusion exists between political power and media owners that restricts the plurality of news, favoring the dominant political interests and hiding the demands, interests and protagonism of other social actors. We study this problem in the Caribbean Region of Colombia. We analyze the information that the town halls of the main cities in the region provide to the media and how the largest print newspapers and main regional television news broadcasters report on local politics. We compare these news stories to establish whether there is a plurality of news reports. In addition, we analyze the key elements of the news items disseminated by private media outlets to establish whether they report a limited vision of reality: the topics covered, the protagonists referred to in headlines and news stories, and the sources against which the news and images are compared. The results reveal shortcomings that result in similar information between public information and private media content, thus limiting the plurality of news reports and the social protagonism of other social agents. Ultimately, this hinders quality journalism that satisfies the interests of citizens.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2078-2489										Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Audiovisual Commun & Advertising, Bellaterra 08193, SpainUniv Norte, Mass Commun & Journalism, Barranquilla 080001, Colombia				2021-04-17	WOS:000633703100001		
J	Wang, Mengyue; Ge, Hongwei; Wang, Xia; Sun, Liang; Hou, Yaqing; Li, Bin										An evolutionary multitasking algorithm for multi-objective feature selection using dual-perspective reduction								ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				152						110764			10.1016/j.engappai.2025.110764					APR 2025		Article	JUL 15 2025	2025	Feature selection inherently involves two conflicting objectives: minimizing the number of selected features and maximizing the classification accuracy. The exponential growth of the search space and complex interactions between features make high-dimensional feature selection challenging. Existing multi-objective methods suffer from slow convergence and limited search capabilities. Moreover, there is a lack of efficient methods for identifying feature subsets with equivalent objective values, which could offer diverse options. To address these issues, this paper proposes an evolutionary multitasking algorithm for multi-objective feature selection using dual-perspective reduction, called DREA-FS. First, a dual-perspective dimensionality reduction strategy is designed to generate simplified and complementary tasks through improved filter-based and group-based methods, facilitating the rapid identification of promising regions. To enable effective information sharing, a dual-archive multitasking optimization mechanism is proposed, which incorporates a diversity archive to preserve feature subsets with equivalent performance and maintain diversity. Coupled with an elite archive that offers convergence guidance, this mechanism achieves a balance between convergence and diversity across tasks, thereby enhancing the ability to search for equivalent feature subsets. Experimental results on 21 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms in classification performance. Besides, DREA-FS can identify different feature subsets with equivalent objective values, supporting decision-makers with diverse options and better interpretability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0952-1976	1873-6769										Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Dalian 116023, Liaoning, Peoples R ChinaHuadian Coal Ind Grp Co Ltd, Huadian Coal Grp Digital Intelligence Technol Co, Beijing 100035, Peoples R China	Huadian Coal Ind Grp Co Ltd			2025-04-29	WOS:001473170000001

The spectral multiplicity, however, may significantly affect the matching accuracy. In this paper, we propose a spectral-multiplicity-tolerant graph matching approach. We start from modeling the spectral multiplicity in the matching error measurement. Next, we address the equal-size graph matching problem, and show how to establish the vertex-to-vertex correspondence by alternatively optimizing the multiplicity matrix C and the permutation matrix P. We also propose a reliable initialization method to make the iterative optimization process converge rapidly. Then, we extend the algorithm to unequal-size graph matching by optimally warping two graphs into the same size. A comprehensive performance evaluation has been conducted on a large synthetic dataset We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on shape retrieval. The experimental results show that compared with existing methods, the proposed approach is more robust to noise and structural corruption and has a comparable complexity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Computer-aided detection (CAD) and diagnosis systems can play a very important role for helping physicians with cancer treatments. This study proposes a hierarchical deep-fusion learning scheme in a CAD framework for the detection of nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans. In the proposed hierarchical approach, a decision is made at each level individually employing the decisions from the previous level. Further, individual decisions are computed for several perspectives of a volume of interest. This study explores three different approaches to obtain decisions in a hierarchical fashion. The first model utilizes raw images. The second model uses a single type of feature image having salient content. The last model employs multi-type feature images. All models learn the parameters by means of supervised learning. The proposed CAD frameworks are tested using lung CT scans from the LIDC/IDRI database. The experimental results showed that the proposed multi-perspective hierarchical fusion approach significantly improves the performance of the classification. The proposed hierarchical deep-fusion learning model achieved a sensitivity of 95% with only 0.4 fp/scan.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1424-8220										Southeastern Louisiana Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hammond, LA 70402 USALouisiana State Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA				2022-12-08	WOS:000887609400001	36433541

There are multiple battles to fight, and the budgets get consumed over time. The final winner in the overall contest is the one who first reaches some amount of total value. Examples include R & D races, sports competition, elections, and many more. A player needs to make adequate sequential actions to win the contest against dynamic competition over time from the others. We are interested in how much budgets the players would need and what actions they should take in order to perform well.We model and study such budget-constrained multi-battle contests where each component battle is a sequential first-price or all-pay auction. We focus on analyzing the 2-player budget ratio that guarantees a player's winning against the other omnipotent player. In the settings considered, we find the optimal budget ratios and the corresponding bidding strategies. Our definition of game, budget constraints, and emphasis on budget analyses provide a new perspective and analysis for multi-battle contests. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Calculating the IC in an intrinsic (i.e., ontology-based) way is particularly convenient due to its accuracy and lack of dependency on annotated corpora. Intrinsic IC calculation models estimate concept probabilities from the taxonomic knowledge (i.e., number of hyponyms and/or hypernyms of the concepts) modelled in an ontology. In this paper, we aim to improve the intrinsic calculation of the IC by leveraging not only the hyponyms and hypernyms of concepts, but also the explicit evidences of synonymy and polysemy that ontologies such as WordNet also model. Specifically, we propose a more accurate intrinsic estimation of the concepts' probabilities in which the IC calculation relies. We evaluate the accuracy of our proposal through a set of comprehensive experiments in which our IC calculation model is tested on a variety of IC-based similarity measures and benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposal obtains consistently good accuracies, which vary less across measures and benchmarks than the most prominent intrinsic IC calculation models available in the literature.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0269-2821	1573-7462										Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, CYBERCAT Ctr Cybersecur Res Catalonia, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss 5,Parc Mediterrani Tecnol, Barcelona 08860, SpainUniv Rovira & Virgili, CYBERCAT Ctr Cybersecur Res Catalonia, UNESCO Chair Data Privacy, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Av Paisos Catalans 26, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain				2020-04-02	WOS:000519571700014

However, current entity linking methods primarily focus on text and image modalities, neglecting the significance of video modality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called the multi-perspective enhanced Subgraph Contrastive Network (SCMEL) and construct a VMEL dataset named SceneMEL, based on tourism domain. We first integrate textual, auditory and visual modal contexts of videos to generate a comprehensive high-recall candidate entity set. Furthermore, a semantic-enhanced video description subgraph generation module is utilized to convert videos into a multimodal feature graph structure and perform subgraph sampling on the domain-specific knowledge graph. Lastly, we conduct contrastive learning on local perspectives (text, audio, visual) within the video subgraphs and the knowledge graph subgraphs, as well as global perspectives, to capture fine-grained semantic information about videos and entities. A series of experimental results on SceneMel demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0218-1940	1793-6403										China Univ Petr East China, Qingdao Inst Software, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266000, Shandong, Peoples R China				2024-09-02	WOS:001299752500002

Moreover, there are some BP with no formal documentation and their execution relies on implicit knowledge of workers. Therefore, analyzing the logs data generated by messaging systems allowing workers to share such implicit knowledge has been a research area of growing interest. BP knowledge introduced by workers in emails could actually cover multiple BP perspectives that would vary from activity, actors, and data perspectives. This article gives an overview of the current state-of-the-art in multi-perspective BP discovery from messaging systems as well as the main existing research questions. Different approaches are presented, discussed, and compared against each other on a qualitative level deduced from the defined set of research questions. The resulting overview covers both advantages and disadvantages of current techniques and the research questions that have not been addressed to date.

The previous elimination algorithm is extended to sequential circuits. A new procedure capable of diagnosing any 'stuck-at' type fault with limited maximum multiplicity in full scan or partial scan designs is developed. The limit is established for each logic partition of the circuit. With this new algorithm, any trial that would lead to faults of multiplicity greater than the established limit is determined a priori and is rejected. This greatly reduces the diagnostic computing time, without affecting its utility, and without probing any internal line. It can also obtain masked faults with or without a multiplicity limit. Experimental results for some full scan circuits from the ISCAS'89 benchmarks are included.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1350-2387											Univ Cantabria, Fac Ciencias, Dpto Elect & Computadores, Santander 39005, Cantabria, Spain				2000-11-01	WOS:000167212800008

We introduce strong multiplicity detection as the ability for the robots to detect the exact number of robots located at a given position. We show that with strong multiplicity detection, there exists a deterministic algorithm solving the gathering problem starting from an arbitrary configuration for n robots if, and only if, n is odd.

Node importance estimation is a technique that is employed extensively in a number of fields, including recommender systems, intelligent search and resource allocation. This study introduces a Multi-perspective attention mechanism Fusion Algorithm for the mapping of multi-perspective features of knowledge graphs to Node Importance Estimation (MFA-NIE). First, structural embedding features, relational predicate features, and attribute features (both textual and quantitative) are established for the nodes. Subsequently, an enhanced attention mechanism is employed to extract, compress, and fuse these features. The fused hidden layer vector is employed in the design of a key-based attention mechanism, which enables the propagation of messages from neighboring nodes to the source node. This process results in the iterative updating of the source node's hidden features. Finally, TOPSIS centrality, based on the topology of the source node, is employed to dynamically adjust the mapping between the fused features and node importance. Experiments were conducted on real-world, large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous knowledge graphs, comparing the MFA-NIE algorithm with traditional and advanced baseline algorithms, including PR, PPR, GENI, RGTN, CLINE, MCRL, and others. The results demonstrate that the MFA-NIE algorithm significantly improves effectiveness and accuracy, showcasing its superiority, versatility, and practical application value.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-0014	1793-6381										Hohai Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence & Automat, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaHohai Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Jiangning Campus,8 Focheng West Rd, Nanjing 211106, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2024-11-09	WOS:001344912300001

To enable robots to cooperate together, swarm robotics employs principles such as communication, coordination, and collaboration. Collaboration among multiple robots can lead to a faster task completion time compared to the utilisation of a single, complex robot. One of the key aspects of swarm robotics is that control is distributed uniformly across the robots in the swarm, which boosts the system's resilience and fault tolerance. Through the use of the robots' embodied sensors and actuators, this distributed control often facilitates the emergence of collective behaviours through the interaction of the robots with one another and with the environment. The purpose of this survey is to examine the reasons behind the lack of utilisation of swarm robots in multi-tasking applications, which will be accomplished by studying previous research works in the field. We examine the literature from the perspective of multi-tasking: we pay particular attention to concepts that contribute to the progress of swarm robotics for multi-tasking applications. To do this, we first examine the different studies in multi-tasking swarm robotics, covering platforms, multi-tasking scenarios, sub-task allocation methodologies, and performance metrics. We then highlight several swarm robotics related disciplines that have significant effect on the development of swarm robotics for multi-tasking problems. We propose two taxonomies: the first categorises works based on the characteristics of the scenarios being handled, whereas the second taxonomy categorises works based on the swarming strategies utilised to achieve multi-tasking capabilities. We finish with a discussion of swarm robots' existing limitations for real-world multi-tasking applications, as well as recommendations for future research directions.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0360-0300	1557-7341										Univ New South Wales, Canberra, ACT 2600, Australia				2024-03-23	WOS:001085637600024		
J									Marta Rosa Amoroso; Pamela Damilano dos Santos		The dream phenomenon: expanding the possibilities of the dream notion by navigating between cultural phycology and Amerindian perspectivism																												Awarded Grant	May 01 2018	2018	This paper aims to broaden the concept of the dream through a dialogue between cultural psychology and anthropological Amerindian perspectivism, mediated by a theoretical-methodological systemization of dialogical multiplication (Guimarães). By bringing together different conceptions of dream that are possible within distinct cultural contexts, we seek to widen its potentialities. The broadening of the concept of the dream will allow for a reflection on the notion of "Self" in the tradition of the western human sciences, as well as construct of reality, by coming into contact with the Amerindian perspective of the notion of personhood and the construct of reality. This work seeks to contribute to a body of knowledge that will allow for new modes of existence and (creative) action in the world through a discussion concerning the oneiric phenomenon.

This is in particular interesting when access to one or more of the above resources is significantly more expensive than the others.We apply new algebraic approach based on Matrix Theory to simplify the algorithms and the proofs of their correctness. We improve the arithmetic complexity of the problem and argue that it is almost optimal. Then we prove tight bound for the minimal number of equivalence queries and almost (up to log factor) tight bound for the number of membership queries.					19th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2006)19th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2006)	JUN 22-25, 2006JUN 22-25, 2006	IBM; Google; Machine Learning Journal; Natl ICT AustraliaIBM; Google; Machine Learning Journal; Natl ICT Australia	Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PACarnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0302-9743		3-540-35294-5									Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel				2006-01-01	WOS:000239587900016

However, a typical life cycle assessment (LCA) can not fulfill this important role from producers and market perspectives. In this research, Three typical V2O5 production processes (PI: sodium roasting, PII: calcium roasting, and PIII: sub-molten salt production process) were selected under the raw material of vanadium slag. A multi-objective assessment under LCA, comprehensive environmental assessment (CEA), and economic assessment perspectives are established for V2O5 production processes. Under the multi-objective comprehensive assessment, the best process was PIII, which combines cleaner production and end-of-pipe treatment with minimal pollutants emission and optimal benefits. Raw material section and vanadium slag are the key process and substance, respectively. With this comprehensive evaluation, the best vanadium production process is revealed which can guide industrial factories to optimize relevant production processes.									17	1	0	0	3	0	18			0921-3449	1879-0658										Hebei Univ Technol, Sch Energy & Environm Engn, Tianjin 300401, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Proc Engn, Innovat Acad Green Manufacture, Beijing Engn Res Ctr Proc Pollut Control, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban & Reg Ecol, Beijing 100085, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China				2023-06-23	WOS:001007144200001

In this paper, we define in a natural way the multiplicity of solutions of zero-dimensional triangular polynomial systems and prove that our definition is equivalent to the classical definition of local (intersection) multiplicity. Then we present an effective and complete algorithm for isolating real solutions with multiplicities of zero-dimensional triangular polynomial systems using our definition. The algorithm is based on interval arithmetic and square-free factorization of polynomials with real algebraic coefficients. The computational results on some examples from the literature are presented.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1674-733X	1869-1919										Peking Univ, Sch Math Sci, LMAM, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China				2011-03-16	WOS:000286497800006

However, it performs poorly in image denoising task. In this letter, we provide a new insight for CSC denoising by revisiting the CSC from a multi-scale perspective. We propose a multi-scale CSC model for image denoising. By unrolling the multi-scale solution into a learnable network, we obtain an interpretable lightweight multi-scale network, namely MCSCNet. Experimental results show that the proposed MCSCNet significantly advances the denoising performance, with an average PSNR improvement of 0.32 dB over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSC based method. In addition, our MCSCNet is on par with many SOTA deep learning based methods, with less network parameters and lower FLOPs. The ablation study also validates the effectiveness of the multi-scale CSC mechanism.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1070-9908	1558-2361										Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci & Technol, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaBeihang Univ, Dept Elect Informat Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China				2022-06-10	WOS:000803477300004

On the other hand, thought of multi-granular cognitive computation simulates the problem-solving process of human brains. It simplifies the complex problems and solves problems from the easier to harder. Therefore, the application of multi-granularity problem-solving ideas or methods to deal with network data mining is increasingly adopted by researchers either intentionally or unintentionally. This paper looks into the domain of network representation learning (NRL). It systematically combs the research work in this field in recent years. In this paper, it is discovered that in dealing with the complexity of the network and pursuing the efficiency of computing resources, the multi-granularity solution becomes an excellent path that is hard to go around. Although there are several papers about survey of NRL, to our best knowledge, we are the first to survey the NRL from the perspective of multi-granular computing. This paper proposes the challenges that NRL meets. Furthermore, the feasibility of solving the challenges of NRL with multi-granular computing methodologies is analyzed and discussed. Some potential key scientific problems are sorted out and prospected in applying multi-granular computing for NRL research.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1088-467X	1571-4128										Chongqing Ind Polytech Coll, Chongqing, Peoples R ChinaZunyi Normal Univ, Zunyi 563100, Guizhou, Peoples R China	Zunyi Normal Univ			2024-04-12	WOS:001193411600002

The purpose of this paper is to respond to call for a multi-perspectives examination of leadership succession in order to embrace the dynamic and complex nature of succession in a family business. Accordingly, the authors investigated the key personal and professional factors associated with effective family-business succession across four key stakeholders: incumbent, successor, family, and nonfamily members.Design/methodology/approach - The explanatory research design included 16 interviews in Phase 1 and 41 prospective case study interviews in Phase 2, both with Australian family businesses that had or were about to experience generational transition.Findings - Incumbents and successor interview findings support the benefits of maintaining a cohesive family business, adaptable family culture, and familiness for effective succession. The authors also identified several personal components (e. g. family-business socialization and external experiences) that can help determine the commitment of successors and how this commitment can change once they assume a leadership position. Business size was the professional component supported by incumbent, successor, and nonfamily members as having a significant impact on succession process. As family business grows and becomes more highly complex, a clearly defined set of procedures become imperative.Practical implications - Family-business practitioners can apply the findings to manage the processes and expectations of family and the business to achieve effective generational succession and thereby increase the sustainability of the business.Originality/value - This research provides a coherent and comprehensive understanding of the interdependencies of competing priorities in the complex succession process that is essential for familybusiness sustainability and performance.									55	0	0	0	1	2	79			1462-6004	1758-7840										Sapir Acad Coll, Ashqelon, IsraelRMIT Univ, Dept Management, Melbourne, Vic, AustraliaEcole Ponts Business Sch, Management, Paris, France	Sapir Acad CollEcole Ponts Business Sch			2017-11-19	WOS:000414027500005

However, there are problems of insufficient data sources, low accuracy of information and the need for manual intervention in construction management, which needs to be improved urgently. This article adopts a hybrid review approach to comprehensively analyze the current research status of KGCM and summarizes the research results of KGCM. In addition, the gaps and future development directions are explored from a multi-modal perspective. The study shows that the research on KGCM under the multi-modal perspective still faces three major challenges: (1) Construction process modeling and optimization, (2) construction resource management and scheduling, (3) construction risk identification and response. This research provides new ideas and methods for the planning, design, construction and operation of engineering projects.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1044-7318	1532-7590										Dalian Univ Technol, Dept Construct Management, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China				2024-08-20	WOS:001291416400001

They are multivariate polynomials whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a Reed-Solomon code. We consider a generalization of their construction, which we call lifted multiplicity codes. These are multivariate polynomial codes whose restriction to any line is a codeword of a multiplicity code (Kopparty, Saraf, Yekhanin 2014). We show that lifted multiplicity codes have a better trade-off between redundancy and a notion of locality called the t-disjoint-repair-group property than previously known constructions. As a corollary, they also give better tradeoffs for PIR codes in the same parameter regimes. More precisely, we show that, for t <= root N, lifted multiplicity codes with length N and redundancy O(t(0.585) root N) have the property that any symbol of a codeword can be reconstructed in t different ways, each using a disjoint subset of the other coordinates. This gives the best known trade-off for this problem for any super-constant t < root N. We also give an alternative analysis of lifted Reed-Solomon codes using dual codes, which may be of independent interest.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0018-9448	1557-9654										Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USAStanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA				2021-03-04	WOS:000612137400004

In particular, we show that if Sn is the maximum multiplicity in a conditioned Bienayme-Galton-Watson tree, then Sn = omega(log n) asymptotically in probability and under the further assumption that E{2 xi} < infinity, we have Sn = O(log n) asymptotically in probability as well. Explicit formulas are given for the constants in both bounds. We conclude by discussing links with an alternate definition of multiplicity that arises in the root-estimation problem.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1462-7264	1365-8050										McGill Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Montreal, PQ, Canada				2022-04-26	WOS:000782806100001

In this paper, we study the multi-mode project scheduling problem from an agency perspective, where agency arises from the risk-averse contractor's hidden effort, which influences the duration and cost of project activities. We formulate the owner's problem of determining the optimal parameters of a linear incentive contract as a bi-level program, where the lower level is a multi-mode project scheduling problem with time/cost trade-offs, representing the contractor's problem. Two benchmarks for the optimal contract are formulated, providing bounds on the expected total cost to the owner, and performance measures are defined accordingly. A stylized model of the owner's problem is presented and solved in closed form for the simple case where an aggregate effort can be exerted at the project level, with restrictive assumptions on the variance of noise and the cost of effort. However, when effort is exerted at the activity level, solving the owner's problem involves the solution of the multi-mode project scheduling problem. A numerical study for such situation is presented, which illustrates the trade-off between incentives and risk, and the effect of this trade-off on different project related costs. The findings from the stylized model and those from the numerical results of the presented example are compared in a computational experiment on 15 randomly generated projects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Particularly, ultrafast lasers, due to their unique interaction with matter, can achieve not only exceptional spatial precision but also meticulously determine the degree of modification. A prime example of this is laser-based 3D printing through multi-photon lithography (MPL). This approach remarkably enables the printing of true 3D structures at the micro- and nanoscale, without the need for masks or cumbersome tools, simply by using computer-aided designs. Owing to these unique capabilities, MPL has emerged as a powerful manufacturing technique across various multidisciplinary fields. The ongoing growth in MPL's utilization has led to notable advancements in printing highly complex structures on different substrates, as well as improvements in resolution and throughput, and the development of novel photosensitive materials, which impressively facilitated MPL's expansion into broader fields over the last few years. In this perspective article, the aim is to highlight these advancements and recent trends in MPL. The current challenges of MPL will be explored, which need to be addressed to ensure its further integration into advanced Additive Manufacturing at the micro- and nanoscale. The future perspectives and opportunities of MPL as a laser-based 3D printing approach will also be discussed.High-resolution laser-based 3D printing through multi-photon lithography (MPL) has recently gained enormous attractiveness across multidisciplinary fields over the past decade due to its versatility, adaptability, and flexibility. In this perspective article, recent advancements and trends in MPL are presented, while the challenges, perspectives, and future opportunities of this laser-based 3D printing approach are discussed. image									28	1	0	0	1	0	29			1863-8880	1863-8899										Fdn Res & Technol Hellas, Inst Elect Struct & Laser, Iraklion 70013, Greece				2024-04-03	WOS:001191026000001

The lateral contrast of US is poor, a well-documented drawback which multi-perspective (MP) imaging could resolve. This study aims to show the feasibility of in vivo multi-perspective 3D + t ultrasound imaging of AAAs for improving the image contrast and displacement accuracy. To achieve this, single-perspective (SP) aortic ultrasound images from three different angles were spatiotemporally registered and fused, and the displacements were compounded. The fused MP had a significantly higher wall-lumen contrast than the SP images, for both patients and volunteers (P < .001). MP radial displacements patterns are smoother than SP patterns in 67% of volunteers and 92% of patients. The MP images from three angles have a decreased tracking error (P < .001 for all participants), and an improved SNRe compared to two out of three SP images (P < .05). This study has shown the added value of MP 3D + t US, improving both image contrast and displacement accuracy in AAA imaging.

The method exploits the structural properties of networks derived from the Chemical Reaction Network Theory. In first instance, the space of parameters is divided in different regions according to the qualitative behavior induced by the parameters in the long term dynamics of the network. Once the regions are identified, a condition for the appearance of multiplicities is checked in the different regions by solving a given optimization problem. In this way. the Method allows the characterization of the whole parameter space of biochemical networks in terms of the appearance or not of multistability. The approach is illustrated through a well-known case of en:dynamic catalysis with substrate inhibition. (C) 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

It has, however, been proven theoretically using very simple distillation models that measuring process flows in units of mass or volume (as is always the case in practical applications) instead of moles may give rise to a bifurcation in the mapping between volumetric reflux flowrate and distillate purity from the case of a single steady state to that of two stable and one unstable steady states being possible for a specific set of actuator settings.This paper verifies the existence of multiple steady states on a semi-industrial scale distillation column separating a mixture of methanol and isopropanol. Simulation studies show that the column will exhibit multiplicity in central parts of the operating window. An experiment is designed by which the unstable branch is mapped and the singular points identified under stable conditions.The results show that distillation column multiplicity is in fact a phenomenon of practical relevance which may lead to operational problems even for binary distillation columns.

The q-analog of the partition function is a polynomial-valued function defined by P-q(xi) = Sigma(k)(i=0) c(i)q(i), where c(i) is the number of ways the weight xi can be written as a sum of exactly i positive roots of a Lie algebra g. The evaluation of the q-multiplicity formula at q = 1 recovers the multiplicity of a weight in an irreducible highest weight representation of g. In this paper, we specialize to the Lie algebra sp(6)(C) and we provide a closed formula for the q-analog of Kostant's partition function, which extends recent results of Shahi, Refaghat, and Marefat. We also describe the supporting sets of the multiplicity formula (known as the Weyl alternation sets of sp(6) (C)), and use these results to provide a closed formula for the q-multiplicity for any pair of dominant integral weights of sp(6)(C). Throughout this work, we provide code to facilitate these computations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0938-1279	1432-0622										Williams Coll, Dept Math & Stat, Williamstown, MA 01267 USAKalamazoo Coll, Dept Math, Kalamazoo, MI 49007 USA				2022-04-16	WOS:000777225900001

However, attempts to develop ontologies suffer from a number of problems in practical situations. This paper outlines an approach to ontology development based on multi perspective modeling - that is, dividing a single ontology into multiple ontologies according to the type of knowledge that is addressed. It is argued that this approach is able to resolve some of the common problems that arise in ontology development.

The entire system output is based on tallying the weighted votes for each decision and choosing the winning one (plurality voting) or one which has the total weight of supporting votes greater than some specified threshold (threshold voting). Each individual unit may abstain from voting. The entire system may also abstain from voting if no decision is ultimately winning. Existing methods of evaluating the correct classification probability (CCP) of WVCs can be applied to limited special cases of these systems (threshold voting) and impose some restrictions on their parameters. In this paper a method is suggested which allows the CCP of WVCs with both plurality and threshold voting to be exactly evaluated without imposing constraints on unit weights. The method is based on using the modified universal generating function technique.

While the class imbalance issue has been extensively investigated within the multi-class paradigm, its study in the MDC context has been limited due to the imbalance shift phenomenon. A sample's classification as a minor or major class instance becomes ambiguous when it belongs to a minor class in one LD and a major class in another. Previous MDC methodologies predominantly emphasized instance-wise criteria, neglecting prediction capabilities from a dimension aspect, i.e., the average classification performance across LDs. We assert the significance of dimension-wise metrics in real-world MDC applications and introduce two such metrics. Furthermore, we observe imbalanced class distributions within each LD and propose a novel Imbalance-Aware fusion Model (IMAM) for addressing the MDC problem. Specifically, we first decompose the task into multiple multi-class classification problems, creating imbalance-aware deep models for each LD separately. This straightforward method performs well across LDs without sacrificing performance in instance-wise criteria. Subsequently, we employ LD-wise models as multiple teachers and transfer their knowledge across all LDs to a unified student model. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our IMAM approach excels in both instance-wise evaluations and the proposed dimension-wise metrics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2095-2228	2095-2236										Nanjing Univ, Natl Key Lab Novel Software Technol, Nanjing 210046, Peoples R ChinaChina Med Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Lab Med, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R ChinaChina Med Univ, Hosp 1, Natl Clin Res Ctr, Lab Med, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China				2024-11-18	WOS:001352814200008

The MRDCA can simultaneously improve the degree of freedom and the angle-resolution by utilizing a class of virtual sparse uniform linear arrays generated by vectorizing the covariance matrix of the received observations of the K-level large scale sparse array. Compared to the prior two level co-prime/nested arrays, the aperture and the angle-resolution can be significantly increased with Kth power law for the K-level array, while the dimension of its scanning space is reduced to 1/K resulted from the spatial aliasing of the MRDCA. As a result, a low-complexity DOA estimation algorithm is proposed by combining a multi-resolution estimation at each level of sparse MRDCA and a followed probability decision strategy which aims at effectively identifying the genuine DOAs and excluding the replicas. In the end, the simulation results are provided to numerically validate the performance of the proposed array geometries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

On the basis of the basic theory of fast neutron multiplicity counting technology, an integrated neutron multiplicity simulation platform is designed and set up with the optimized combination of multiple computational tools. The platform consists of four modules: geometric modeling, particle transport, data processing and analysis, and cloud data management modules. It can implement multiple functions, such as automatic modeling, neutron transport, data visual analysis and simulation, and management of cloud platform data. Finally, simulation calculations and an experimental study of fast neutron multiplicity based on a liquid scintillator are performed with this platform. The results show that the deviation between the simulation results and the experimental results is less than 10%, and thus the simulation platform can be used for mutual inspection of mass.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0969-8043	1872-9800										Xian Univ Posts & Telecommun, Xian 710121, Peoples R China				2021-05-13	WOS:000640178800001	33838520

In their approach, ontology is dissociated from concept, and instead conceptualization is left up to the epistemic activity of the information system user. A new spatial ontology model is explicated that supports multiple perspective-relative conceptual projections of the same domain. With an example domain and a demo application, they provide a preliminary proof of concept of how different perspectives yield alternative classifications, categorizations and hierarchies, all the way to a different ways of narrating the domain. The results suggest the potential of multi-perspective knowledge organization systems that not only support search and retrieval of information but even the articulation and conceptual disposition of information.									12	0	0	0	1	0	14			0943-7444											Sodertorn Univ, Sch Commun Media & Informat Technol, S-14189 Huddinge, SwedenUniv Jyvaskyla, Agora Ctr, FI-40014 Jyvaskyla, Finland				2011-01-01	WOS:000297631100004

The approach assumes an initial design, with a preassigned SISO control structure, has been obtained and is useful where there is an input multiplicity in the operating region. The condition for input multiplicity is obtained by inflating the state space model with a state representing the locus of the point of zero gain. The multiplicity condition is determined using the bifurcation analysis package, AUTO, which allows the study of the influence of operating conditions and parameters on input multiplicity behaviour to obtain an expression for the point of zero gain as a function of the design and disturbance variables. A process modification problem is formulated within an optimisation framework and solved to determine the minimal design parameter changes necessary to avoid input multiplicity given an assumed maximal disturbance. Results are presented for the application of the algorithm to a CSTR system demonstrating that small changes in some design variables can avoid input multiplicity problems in this case, and that the method can determine the changes necessary.

Then, we apply these formulas to solve the problem in the general case, by showing that the multiplicity of an arbitrary affine isolated zero of a generic system with given supports equals the multiplicity of the origin as a common zero of a generic system with an associated family of supports. The formulas obtained are in the spirit of the classical Bernstein's theorem, in the sense that they depend on the combinatorial structure of the system, namely, geometric numerical invariants associated to the supports, such as mixed volumes of convex sets and, alternatively, mixed integrals of convex functions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0179-5376	1432-0444										Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Matemat, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaUniv Buenos Aires, Inst Invest Matemat Luis A Santalo IMAS, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, ArgentinaUniv Buenos Aires, Dept Ciencias Exactas, Ciclo Basico Comun, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina				2019-11-18	WOS:000494042900004

We provide an algorithm which is polynomial in the size of the Q-automaton and in the maximum length of the given counterexamples. As a consequence, we have that Q-automata are probably approximately correctly learnable (PAC-learnable) in polynomial time when multiplicity queries are allowed. A corollary of this result is that regular languages are polynomially predictable using membership queries with respect to the representation of unambiguous nondeterministic automata. This is important since there are unambiguous automata such that the equivalent deterministic automaton has an exponentially larger number of states.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			0097-5397											UNIV AQUILA,DIPARTIMENTO MATEMAT PURA & APPLICATA,I-67010 LAQUILA,ITALY				1996-12-01	WOS:A1996VV39500007

In this paper, we propose a bi-level Erlang Planning Network (EPN) architecture, which is composed of an upper-level agent and several multi-scale parallel sub-agents, trained in an iterative way. The proposed method focuses upon the expansion of representation by environment: a multi-perspective over the world model, which presents a varied way to represent an agent's knowledge about the world that alleviates the problem of falling into local optimal points and enhances robustness during the progress of model planning. Moreover, our experiments evaluate EPN on a range of continuous-control tasks in MuJoCo, the evaluation results show that the proposed framework finds exemplar solutions faster and consistently reaches the state-of-the-art performance.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This approach, however, suffers from the quality of the generated pseudo-labels, and generating higher quality pseudo-labels is the main challenge that needs to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic segmentation based on Multi-perspective pseudo-label Generation and Confidence-weighted Training (MGCT). First, we present a multi-perspective pseudo-label generation strategy that considers both global and local semantic perspectives. This strategy prioritizes pixels in all images by the global and local predictions, and subsequently generates pseudo-labels for different pixels in stages according to the ranking results. Our pseudo-label generation method shows superior suitability for semi-supervised semantic segmentation compared to other approaches. Second, we propose a confidence-weighted training method to alleviate performance degradation caused by unstable pixels. Our training method assigns confident weights to unstable pixels, which reduces the interference of unstable pixels during training and facilitates the efficient training of the model. Finally, we validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, and the results indicate that we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on both datasets in all settings.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1520-9210	1941-0077										Xiangtan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Informat Proc, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R ChinaFudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R ChinaHunan Normal Univ, Hunan Prov Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Language Inf, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China				2025-01-27	WOS:001398670600007

Images from three different perspectives are captured by a 3CCD camera using a reflective-based pseudo-vision system. These images are then separated by the different CCD channels, and the correlation algorithm for the multi-camera DIC system is adopted to evaluate the images. Compared to the conventional multi-camera DIC system, the proposed system is much more compact. In addition, the proposed system has no loss of spatial resolution, compares to the traditional single camera DIC system. The complex surface measurement ability and the measurement accuracy is significantly improved through the use of the multi-camera DIC algorithm.

The desire of being able to tolerate both phenomena introduces the need to evaluate and quantify the significance of a detected inconsistency as well as to measure the degree of conflict and uncertainty of the merged view as the specification process evolves.We show in this paper to what extent disagreement and incompleteness are closely interrelated and play a central role to obtain a measure of the level of inconsistency and to define a merging operator whose aim is getting the model which best reflects the combined knowledge of all stakeholders. We will also propose two kinds of interesting and useful orderings among perspectives which are based on differences of behavior and inconsistency, respectively. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, a new technique is presented for modeling the charged particles multiplicity distribution Pn of Proton-Proton (PP) collisions using an efficient DNN model. The charged particles multiplicity n, the total center of mass energy root s, and the pseudorapidity eta used as input in DNN model and the desired output is P-n. DNN was trained to build a function, which studies the relationship between P-n (n, root s, eta). The DNN model showed a high degree of consistency in matching the data distributions. The DNN model is used to predict with P-n not included in the training set. The expected P-n had effectively merged the experimental data and the values expected indicate a strong agreement with Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for ATLAS measurement at root s = 0.9, 7 and 8 TeV.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0217-7323	1793-6632										Sultan Qaboos Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Phys, Muscat 123, OmanAin Shams Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Cairo 11566, Egypt				2021-01-05	WOS:000599874000003

The API call sequence of malware reflects its dynamic behavior during execution, which is difficult to disguise. Therefore, API call sequence can serve as a robust feature for the detection and classification of malware. The statistical analysis presented in this paper reveals two distinct characteristics within the API call sequences of different malware: (1) the API existence feature caused by frequent calls to the APIs with some special functions, and (2) the API transition feature caused by frequent calls to some special API subsequence patterns. Based on these two characteristics, this paper proposes MINES, a Multi-perspective apI call sequeNce bEhavior fuSion malware classification Method. Specifically, the API existence features from different perspectives are described by two graphs that model diverse rich and complex existence relationships between APIs, and we adopt the graph contrastive learning framework to extract the consistent shared API existence feature from two graphs. Similarly, the API transition features of different hops are described by the multi-order transition probability matrices. By treat each order as a channel, a CNN-based contrastive learning framework is adopted to extract the API transition feature. Finally, the two kinds of extracted features are fused to classify malware. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate the superiority of MINES over various state-of-the-arts by a large margin.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0167-4048	1872-6208										Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Integrated Adm Technol Informat S, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaInformat Technol Serv Ctr Peoples Court, Beijing 100745, Peoples R China	Informat Technol Serv Ctr Peoples Court			2024-11-13	WOS:001350323000001

A key challenge in this domain lies in effectively extracting and aligning multi-granular features across image and text modalities. In this paper, we propose the Multi-scale Feature Refinement Network (MSFR) to address the cross-modal feature matching challenge in text-based person search. Our specific contributions to advancing text-based person search within artificial intelligence are follows: First, Perspective Scaling transforms person feature maps into multi-scale global feature maps, enhancing global feature diversity through multi-scale fusion and feature space expansion. Second, Multi-scale Textual Attention captures multi-scale textual features using various convolution kernel sizes, enhancing the model's comprehension of multi-level information in text. Third, Adaptive Regularization dynamically adjusts the weight coefficients of local feature losses for image-text pairs during model training, assigning higher importance to critical local features. The application of our MSFR in engineering is demonstrated through extensive experiments on three text-based person search datasets has consistently demonstrated superior performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-1976	1873-6769										Guangxi Normal Univ, Key Lab Educ Blockchain & Intelligent Technol, Minist Educ, Guilin 541004, Peoples R ChinaGuangxi Normal Univ, Guangxi Key Lab Multisource Informat Min & Secur, Guilin 541004, Peoples R ChinaGuangxi Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Liuzhou 545006, Peoples R ChinaGuangxi Normal Univ, Teachers Coll Vocat & Tech Educ, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China				2025-08-01	WOS:001537489600001

This paper identifies the emergent and future conditions that most and least matter to enterprise risk management, demonstrating a risk analysis model that is grounded in latest theory of multi-perspective scenario-based preferences analysis. The effort extends theory and practice by suggesting a semi-quantitative method for iteration and applying a multi-perspective approach that tests the method in the new circumstances of an advanced communication system. It demonstrates how scenarios relatively influence the prioritization of initiatives for each key stakeholder and how to update the assessment for the monitoring of risk over months and years of the deployment. The approach is demonstrated for the deployment of a public safety wireless broadband network throughout the US and should be of interest to practitioners for building resilience in the deployment of complex technological systems.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0951-8320	1879-0836										Univ Virginia, Dept Engn Syst & Environm, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USAOld Dominion Univ, Virginia Modeling Anal & Simulat Ctr, Suffolk, VA USACommonwealth Ctr Adv Logist Syst, Petersburg, VA USA	Commonwealth Ctr Adv Logist Syst			2020-05-05	WOS:000527842500004

Our method generalizes the "Weierstrass iteration", defined by Ruatta, to the case when the input system is not exact, i.e. when it is near to a system with multiple roots, but itself might not have multiple roots. First, using interpolation techniques, we define the "generalized Weierstrass map", a map from the set of possible roots to the set of systems which have these roots with the given multiplicity structure. Minimizing the 2-norm of this map formulates the problem as an optimization problem over all possible roots. We use Gauss-Newton iteration to compute the closest system to the input with given root multiplicity together with its roots. We give explicitly an iteration function which computes this minimum. These results extends previous results of Zhi and Wu and results of Zeng from the univariate case to the multivariate case. Finally, we give a simplified version of the iteration function analogously to the classical Weierstrass iteration, which allows a component-wise expression, and thus reduces the computational cost of each iteration. We provide numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the topological complexity of pavement defects regions, most existing detection methods are limited to a limited number of types of defects, which results in unsatisfactory detection results for multi-classified defects. Several studies have used enhanced data to address this issue, however, few have considered the inefficiency caused by imbalanced differences between classes from the perspective of the network model itself. In light of this issue, our goal is to fill this gap by better exploring the fusion of different feature information to improve the performance of the network. As a result, we propose a multi-perspective feature collaborative perception learning network (MFCPLNet), which uses the model's contextual information to guide high-quality multi-classified defects detection and that can be adapted to various pavement conditions. Specifically, for adaptive feature extraction, an irregular perceptual extraction network (IPENet) with enhanced edge information is first designed to draw upon hybrid deformable convolution for efficient network block hybridization. Additionally, a multi-balanced collaborative learning mechanism (MCLM) consisting of auxiliary axial information and 3D feature guidance is constructed to enhance deep semantic features, improve the localization of defects in defective regions, and compensate for weak category supervision. Lastly, in the detection head, an iterative soft aggregation module has been designed to enhance scalable spatial interactions. The results of extensive testing were based on publicly available pavement defects datasets. Based on the proposed network, the mAP index reaches 29.6% and 33.8%, respectively, an increase of 8.3% and 4.6% over the baseline, which is qualitatively and quantitatively superior to mainstream methods.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1051-2004	1095-4333										Tianjin Chengjian Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Tianjin 300384, Peoples R ChinaTianjin Branch China Tower Corp Ltd, Business Support Dept, Tianjin 300011, Peoples R China	Tianjin Branch China Tower Corp Ltd			2024-07-16	WOS:001265924000001

An often critical requirement of subset identification methods is multiplicity control, by which the family-wise Type I error rate is controlled, rather than the Type I error rate of each covariate-determined hypothesis separately. The credible subset (or credible subgroup) method provides a multiplicity-controlled estimate of the target subset in the form of two bounding subsets: one which entirely contains the target subset, and one which is entirely contained by it.We introduce a new R package, credsubs, which constructs credible subset estimates using a sample from the joint posterior distribution of any regression model, a description of the covariate space, and a function mapping the parameters and covariates to the subset criterion. We demonstrate parametric and nonparametric applications of the package to a clinical trial dataset and a neuroimaging dataset, respectively.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1548-7660											Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USAUniv Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USACounterpoint Stat Consulting LLC, Minneapolis, MN USA	Counterpoint Stat Consulting LLC			2020-09-15	WOS:000565254200001

Due to the heterogeneous nature of metrology data derived from various sources, knowledge silos commonly emerge, complicating the integration and reuse of knowledge. This study introduces an entity alignment model leveraging multi-perspective embedding. It employs a multi-scale graph convolutional network enhanced by a gating mechanism that aggregates multi-hop neighborhood features to capture the structural embeddings of nodes. Additionally, the model utilizes TransD for representing complex relationships and BERT for capturing entity attributes, facilitating more comprehensive entity representations. Entity alignment is then accomplished by integrating structural, relational, and attribute embeddings using a weighted strategy. In this study, we conducted experimental validation on aeronautical metrology data and also assessed our proposed model on five benchmark datasets. The results indicate that our model significantly outperforms comparative models, demonstrating its potential to enhance the management and application of aeronautical metrology data.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1474-0346	1873-5320										Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Suzhou Res Inst, Suzhou, Peoples R China				2024-11-11	WOS:001348409000001

A good agreement is found between the measured dead time parameters of a neutron multiplicity counter described in the literature and the dead time parameters calculated using the presented approach.Program summaryProgram title: COLONEMACatalogue identifier: AEYS_v1_0Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.ukisummaries/AEYS_v1_0.htmlProgram obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

It is surprising that, with such a popular paradigm, little agreement exists with regard to the definition, domain, and challenges of multi-tenancy. This absence is detrimental to the research community and the industry, as it hampers progress in the domain of multi-tenancy and enables organizations and academics to wield their own definitions to further their commercial or research agendas.In this article, a systematic mapping study on multi-tenancy is described in which 761 academic papers and 371 industrial blogs are analysed. Both the industrial and academic perspective are assessed, in order to get a complete overview. The definition and topic maps provide a comprehensive overview of the domain, while the research agenda, listing four important research topics, provides a roadmap for future research efforts.

This restricts their scalability to a large number of logo classes subject to limited labelling budget. In this work, we consider a more scalable open logo detection problem where only a fraction of logo classes are fully labelled whilst the remaining classes are only annotated with a clean icon image (e.g. 1-shot icon supervised). To generalise and transfer knowledge of fully supervised logo classes to other 1-shot icon supervised classes, we propose a Multi-Perspective Cross-Class (MPCC) domain adaptation method. In a data augmentation principle, MPCC conducts feature distribution alignment in two perspectives. Specifically, we align the feature distribution between synthetic logo images of 1-shot icon supervised classes and genuine logo images of fully supervised classes, and that between logo images and non-logo images, concurrently. This allows for mitigating the domain shift problem between model training and testing on 1-shot icon supervised logo classes, simultaneously reducing the model overfitting towards fully labelled logo classes. Extensive comparative experiments show the advantage of MPCC over existing state-of-the-art competitors on the challenging QMUL-OpenLogo benchmark (Su et al., 2018).									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1077-3142	1090-235X										Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaQueen Mary Univ London, London E1 4NS, EnglandVis Semant Ltd, London E1 4NS, England	Vis Semant Ltd			2021-07-22	WOS:000672565100002

However, it is still difficult to determine the spatial extent of a remote sensing object and the size of a sample patch. If the patch size is too large, it will include too many remote sensing objects and their complex spatial relationships. This will increase the computational burden of the image captioning network and reduce its precision. If the patch size is too small, it often fails to provide enough environmental and contextual information, which makes the remote sensing object difficult to describe. To address this problem, we propose a multi-scale semantic long short-term memory network (MS-LSTM). The remote sensing images are paired into image patches with different spatial scales. First, the large-scale patches have larger sizes. We use a Visual Geometry Group (VGG) network to extract the features from the large-scale patches and input them into the improved MS-LSTM network as the semantic information, which provides a larger receptive field and more contextual semantic information for small-scale image caption so as to play the role of global perspective, thereby enabling the accurate identification of small-scale samples with the same features. Second, a small-scale patch is used to highlight remote sensing objects and simplify their spatial relations. In addition, the multi-receptive field provides perspectives from local to global. The experimental results demonstrated that compared with the original long short-term memory network (LSTM), the MS-LSTM's Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) has been increased by 5.6% to 0.859, thereby reflecting that the MS-LSTM has a more comprehensive receptive field, which provides more abundant semantic information and enhances the remote sensing image captions.									10	2	0	0	1	0	12				2220-9964										Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Wuhan 430070, Hubei, Peoples R China				2019-10-17	WOS:000488826400057

Assume that, a manufacturer has a limited budget for an item's advertisement, with this budget, it is only possible for him to market this item to limited users. How to select the most suitable users that will increase advertisement revenue? It seems to be an insurmountable problem to the existing recommendation algorithms. To address this issue, a new item orientated recommendation algorithm from the multi-view perspective is proposed in this paper. Different from the existing recommendation algorithms, this model provides the target items with the users that are the most possible to purchase them. The basic idea is to simultaneously calculate the relationships between items and the rating differences between users from a multi-view model in which the purchasing records of each user are regarded as a view and each record is seen as a node in a view. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of item orientated recommendation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many efforts have paid on developing QoS prediction approaches in the past decade leveraging the principle of collaborative filtering. But there remain many challenging issues concerning multi-task prediction requirements, feature selection for heterogeneous prediction tasks, and model training. To this end, we propose an effective personalized service QoS prediction method from the perspective of multi-task learning, named PMT. PMT consists of specially-designed feature selection components and a multi-step model training strategy. The feature selection method leverages the principle of multi-expert decision-making and self-attention mechanism. The multi-step model training enables a weight-free configuration for parallel prediction tasks. Experimental results on a large dataset with two tasks and a small dataset with three tasks demonstrate that PMT is superior to the state-of-the-art QoS prediction methods.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-4537											Yunnan Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R ChinaYunnan Univ, Key Lab Intelligent Syst & Comp Yunnan Prov, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R ChinaFudan Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Normal Univ, Sch Elect & Automat Engn, Nanjing 210024, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China				2024-01-11	WOS:001119505800035

In the past few decades, the multi-scale simulation technique has drawn increasing attention for its remarkable ability to overcome the challenges of complex system simulation with unknown mechanisms and expensive computational costs. In this survey, we will systematically review the literature on multi-scale simulation of complex systems from the perspective of knowledge and data. First, we will present background knowledge about simulating complex systems and the scales in complex systems. Then, we divide the main objectives of multi-scale modeling and simulation into five categories by considering scenarios with clear scale and scenarios with unclear scale, respectively. After summarizing the general methods for multi-scale simulation based on the clues of knowledge and data, we introduce the adopted methods to achieve different objectives. Finally, we introduce the applications of multi-scale simulation in typical matter systems and social systems.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0360-0300	1557-7341										Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol BNRist, Beijing, Peoples R China				2024-12-09	WOS:001356234100001

This paper proposes PAC-MVSNet, which integrates perspective-aware convolution (PAC) and metadata-enhanced cost volumes to address the challenges in reflective and texture-less regions. PAC dynamically aligns convolutional kernels with scene perspective lines, while the use of metadata (e.g., camera pose distance) enables geometric reasoning during cost aggregation. In PAC-MVSNet, we introduce feature matching with long-range tracking that utilizes both internal and external focuses to integrate extensive contextual data within individual images as well as across multiple images. To enhance the performance of the feature matching with long-range tracking, we also propose a perspective-aware convolution module that directs the convolutional kernel to capture features along the perspective lines. This enables the module to extract perspective-aware features from images, improving the feature matching. Finally, we crafted a specific 2D CNN that fuses image priors, thereby integrating keyframes and geometric metadata within the cost volume to evaluate depth planes. Our method represents the first attempt to embed the existing physical model knowledge into a network for completing MVS tasks, which achieved optimal performance using multiple benchmark datasets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1424-8220										Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Design, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Aeronaut & Astronaut, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R ChinaXian Inst Surveying & Mapping, Xian 710054, Peoples R ChinaMinist Nat Resources, Land Satellite Remote Sensing Applicat Ctr, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China	Xian Inst Surveying & Mapping			2025-04-19	WOS:001465757200001	40218745

A particular challenge facing current IT risk assessment methods is to provide accessible abstractions on matters of IT risk that attend to both managerial and technical perspectives of the stakeholders involved. In this paper, we investigate whether a conceptual modeling method can address essential requirements in the IT risk assessment domain, and which structural and procedural features such a method entails. The research follows a design research process in which we describe a research artifact, and evaluate it to assess whether it meets the intended goals. In the paper, we specify requirements and assumptions underlying the method construction, discuss the structural specification of the method and its design rationale, present a prototypical application scenario, and provide an initial method evaluation. The results indicate that multi-perspective modeling methods satisfy requirements specific to the IT risk assessment domain, and that such methods, in fact, provide abstractions on matters of IT risk accessible to both a technical and a managerial audience.									35	1	0	0	0	0	39			1387-3326	1572-9419										Univ Duisburg Essen, Inst Comp Sci & Business Informat Syst, D-45141 Essen, Germany				2011-12-14	WOS:000297202100010

This paper proposed a method of synchronously imaging from different perspectives to present the whole surface of "kyoho" table grape with the front-surface reflective mirrors. A preliminary grade was conducted to distinguish the disqualified cluster by multi-perspective imaging method using the mirrors and mono-camera. A grape image with three bunches in every 120A degrees perspective was simultaneously imaged by once acquisition of mono-camera, and meanwhile, the weight of grape was weighed by a weighing senor. After series of image process stages, the grape bunches of one actual and two virtual regions were segmented out and the size of virtual regions was affined to the size of the actual region. The compactness of grape cluster was estimated by the deviating percentage between the sensing weight and the fitting weight which was regressed with the average area by exponential function. The ratio of contour curve's width was extracted from the bunch region and was used to classify the disqualified shoulder pole of grape shape. Finally, the disqualified shape of table grape was classified by the weight, region size, compactness, and ratio and got a 95.5 % correct rate. Results show this preliminary grade is feasible to inspect the disqualified cluster shape of table grape by the multi-perspective simultaneously imaging method.									7	2	0	0	3	0	9			1936-9751	1936-976X										Jiangsu Univ, Sch Food & Biol Engn, Xuefu Rd 301, Zhenjiang City 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2016-02-17	WOS:000369001300025

Although mining industries have many advantages, inappropriate mining activities have led to dramatic environment and resource depletion. To achieve a balance of such activities, sustainable practices are a must and should be followed by the industry. Of the various sustainable practices, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) has gained prominence recently. In developed countries, CSR is at an advanced level, but in developing countries especially in South Asia CSR is in a preliminary stage, due to both known and unknown reasons. This paper investigates drivers for CSR implementation in the mining industry in India, a developing nation in South Asia. Some studies focused on CSR issues but were limited to industrial perspectives without considering multi-stakeholders. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by analysing CSR drivers from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, including governmental, media, and societal associations. We propose a model framework, illustrated with a case study from an industrial unit in India, through Fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy DEMATEL). Based on these findings, industries can increase their chances of practicing value-added CSR in industrial environments. This study extends the scope of this problem through varying multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tools and different environments such as grey, fuzzy, and other approaches. The additional drivers can also be validated with statistical work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, existing single prediction models frequently encounter challenges such as limited adaptability and restricted prediction accuracy when addressing complex and variable weather conditions. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-feature perspective clustering method that integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features. By performing similar day clustering, historical data are segmented into sub-datasets representing three weather conditions, which are then used to construct targeted prediction sub-models, thereby improving the model's adaptability and training performance. Additionally, a probabilistic reconstruction model based on Bayesian theorem is developed. This model combines the features of fuzzy C-means clustering and variational autoencoders to optimize the weighting strategy, further enhancing prediction accuracy. Experimental results on multi-regional datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, highlighting its superior performance and robust cross-regional adaptability in GHI day-ahead prediction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-5442	1873-6785										Taiyuan Univ Technol, Coll Elect & Power Engn, Taiyuan 030024, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Gemeng US China Clean Energy R&D Ctr Co Ltd, Taiyuan 030031, Peoples R China	Shanxi Gemeng US China Clean Energy R&D Ctr Co Ltd			2025-03-21	WOS:001442798600001		
J	Statnikov, Alexander; Aliferis, Constantin F.										Analysis and Computational Dissection of Molecular Signature Multiplicity								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				6	5					e1000790			10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000790							Article	MAY 2010	2010	Molecular signatures are computational or mathematical models created to diagnose disease and other phenotypes and to predict clinical outcomes and response to treatment. It is widely recognized that molecular signatures constitute one of the most important translational and basic science developments enabled by recent high-throughput molecular assays. A perplexing phenomenon that characterizes high-throughput data analysis is the ubiquitous multiplicity of molecular signatures. Multiplicity is a special form of data analysis instability in which different analysis methods used on the same data, or different samples from the same population lead to different but apparently maximally predictive signatures. This phenomenon has far-reaching implications for biological discovery and development of next generation patient diagnostics and personalized treatments. Currently the causes and interpretation of signature multiplicity are unknown, and several, often contradictory, conjectures have been made to explain it. We present a formal characterization of signature multiplicity and a new efficient algorithm that offers theoretical guarantees for extracting the set of maximally predictive and non-redundant signatures independent of distribution. The new algorithm identifies exactly the set of optimal signatures in controlled experiments and yields signatures with significantly better predictivity and reproducibility than previous algorithms in human microarray gene expression datasets. Our results shed light on the causes of signature multiplicity, provide computational tools for studying it empirically and introduce a framework for in silico bioequivalence of this important new class of diagnostic and personalized medicine modalities.									46	0	0	0	29	0	50				1553-7358										NYU, Sch Med, Ctr Hlth Informat & Bioinformat, New York, NY 10003 USANYU, Sch Med, Dept Med, New York, NY USANYU, Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY USAVanderbilt Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, Nashville, TN USAVanderbilt Univ, Dept Biostat, Nashville, TN USA				2010-05-01	WOS:000278759700022	20502670

In these applications, the measure support is used to capture the popularity of patterns, while the measure occupancy is adopted to capture the completeness of patterns. Existing methods for mining task-oriented patterns usually combine these two measures as one measure for optimization, and require users to set the prior parameters such as the minimum support threshold min_sup, the minimum occupancy threshold min_occ and the relative importance preference lambda between support and occupancy. However, it is very difficult for users to set optimal values for these parameters especially when they do not have any prior knowledge in real applications. To overcome this challenge, we propose an evolutionary approach for pattern mining from a multi-objective perspective since support and occupancy are conflicting. Specifically, we first transform this pattern mining problem into a multi-objective optimization problem. Then we propose an effective multi-objective pattern mining evolutionary algorithm for finding optimal pattern set, which does not need to specify the prior parameters min_sup, min_occ and lambda. Finally, we select best patterns from the obtained pattern set for final pattern recommendation. Experimental results on two real task-oriented applications, namely, goods match recommendation in Taobao and print area recommendation in SmartPrint, and several large synthetic datasets demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.									60	1	0	0	4	0	60			1556-603X	1556-6048										Anhui Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp & Signal Proc, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaUniv Surrey, Dept Comp, Guildford, Surrey, EnglandSouthern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China				2017-08-01	WOS:000407056300006

Applying a retrospective strategy for data collection, three rounds of interviews were conducted with representatives of all partner firms. The data were complemented by documentary analysis of both internal documents and publicly available information.Findings - The findings suggest that the use of governance mechanisms in multi-partner alliances depends on the characteristics of alliance phases. Relational governance is most important in the exploration and development phases, while the importance of contractual governance comes to the fore during the development and finalization phases. Despite the predominance of one type of mechanism, the findings support a complementary perspective of governance mechanisms.Research limitations/implications - The results of a single case study offer limited generalizability and should thus be treated with caution. More cross-industry, cross-national studies should be conducted to verify the applicability of the findings to other industries, cultures and geographical contexts.Practical implications - Managers should be aware that different phases of the alliance life cycle have different control and coordination needs, and should rely on different mechanisms during different phases of the alliance.Originality/value - The authors have synthesized insights from various perspectives (transaction cost economics, organization theory, social exchange theory), and developed a multidisciplinary approach to multi-partner collaborations.									5	0	0	1	0	0	6			1746-5265	1746-5273										Univ Politecn Madrid, Dept Ind Engn Business Adm & Stat, Madrid, SpainPolitecn Milan, Dept Management Econ & Ind Engn, Milan, Italy				2016-11-23	WOS:000386788900003

However, the effectiveness of the NRS model is limited by its reliance on the grid search method to determine the optimal neighbourhood parameter, insensitivity to data distribution under different features, and consideration of uncertainty measures from only one single perspective. To address the aforementioned issues, this study first defines a spatial function that can obtain information about the distribution of samples in space according to the change in the feature subset. On this basis, three perspectives of dynamic neighbourhoods are proposed: pessimistic, neutral, and optimistic. Next, the concept of the dynamic neighbourhood rough set (DNRS) model is developed. The most significant feature of this model is its adaptive ability to dynamically update the neighbourhood radius of samples on the basis of the information of their distribution in space, without the necessity of setting neighbourhood parameters artificially. Then, algebraic and information-theoretic views are introduced to propose multi-perspective dynamic neighbourhood entropy measures, which effectively measure the uncertainty of the data. In addition, a nonmonotonic feature selection algorithm based on mutual information is designed to overcome the limitations of feature selection algorithms that rely on monotonic evaluation functions. This algorithm utilizes multi-perspective dynamic neighbourhood entropy measures from a neutral perspective. Finally, to mitigate the high time complexity in feature selection for high-dimensional datasets, the Fisher score is introduced in an initial dimensionality reduction method. The results of the experiment show that the algorithm effectively eliminates redundant features and improves accuracy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-669X	1573-7497										Henan Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Xinxiang 453007, Peoples R ChinaEngn Lab Intelligence Business & Internet Things, Xinxiang 453007, Henan, Peoples R China	Engn Lab Intelligence Business & Internet Things			2025-02-21	WOS:001420963300002

Therefore, it is necessary to conduct crude oil price forecasting. Based on the forecasting research of multi-source information and decomposition-ensemble, we combine the two into a model and propose a multi perspective crude oil price forecasting model under a new decomposition-ensemble framework. Specifically, the crude oil price series is decomposed and reconstructed into several modes through variational mode decomposition (VMD) and fuzzy entropy (FE). Further, we screen the effective predictors from structured and unstructured multi-source data using the Granger causality test, and select the optimal input features through random forest recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE). Finally, each reconstruction mode is individually forecasted on the basis of the selected different input features and the forecasting values obtained are combined and integrated; the final result is obtained from the integrating prediction results through the error evaluation criterion. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) daily spot price is adopted to validate the performance of our proposed model. The empirical results show that compared with the benchmark models, the proposed model can significantly improve forecasting accuracy.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			0301-4207	1873-7641										Lanzhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Lanzhou 730020, Peoples R ChinaXi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710049, Peoples R China				2022-06-08	WOS:000798580000005

On the other hand, another framework is proposed to integrate typical multi-learner based approaches for problem solving, particularly on Gaussian mixture based data clustering and local subspace learning, multi-sets mixture based object detection and motion estimation, and multi-agent coordinated problem solving. Typical learning algorithms, especially those that base on rival penalized competitive learning (RPCL) and Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) learning, are summarized from a unified perspective with new extensions. Furthermore, the two different frameworks are not only examined with one viewed crossly from a perspective of the other, with new insights and extensions, but also further unified into a general problem solving paradigm that consists of five basic mechanisms in terms of acquisition, allocation, amalgamation, admission, and affirmation, or shortly A5 paradigm.

More precisely, the multiplicity behavior of polystyrene production in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) is carried out by the numerical simulations through the Van Heerden diagram and the phase plane. Furthermore, the bifurcation diagrams in terms of two different inputs including jacket temperature and volumetric flow rate of initiator predict the appearance of multiplicity behavior as well as the saddle-node bifurcation points. The results, firstly, verify that the multiplicity behavior of the system appears under considered operating conditions.

Thus, a multi-perspective collaborative planning method considering DES is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a double layer DN planning structure from the overall perspective is proposed. By considering the planning layer and the operation layer, the overall planning cost can be minimized. Then, the benefit relationships among DN operators, DG operators, and energy station (ES) operators are analyzed, and the benefit models of different stakeholders are established. On this basis, the multi-agent game planning model of DN considering the limited rationality of stakeholders is constructed. And then, the optimal planning and operation scheme of the DN with DES is determined through the adaptive evolutionary game method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the simulation of a certain 42-node distribution system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0142-0615	1879-3517										Hunan Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R ChinaState Grid Econ & Technol Res Inst Co, Beijing 102209, Peoples R China	State Grid Econ & Technol Res Inst Co			2025-03-01	WOS:001428564300001

Due to this deliberate ambiguity, accurately detecting sarcasm can encourage the comprehension of users' real intentions. Therefore, sarcasm detection is a critical and challenging task for sentiment analysis. In previous research, neural network-based models are generally unsatisfactory when dealing with complex sarcastic expressions. To ameliorate this situation, we propose a multi-perspective contrastive learning framework for sarcasm detection, called SLGC, which is guided by sememe knowledge and label information based on the pre-trained neural model. For the in-instance perspective, we leverage the sememe, the minimum meaning unit, to guide the contrastive learning to produce high-quality sentence representations. For the between-instance perspective, we utilize label information to guide contrastive learning to mine potential interaction relationships between sarcastic expressions. Experiments on two public benchmark sarcasm detection dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art model.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1868-8071	1868-808X										Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen, Joint Lab HITSZ CMS, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaKings Coll London, London, EnglandGuangdong Prov Key Lab Novel Secur Intelligence T, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaPeng Cheng Lab, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaChina Merchants Secur Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R China	Guangdong Prov Key Lab Novel Secur Intelligence TChina Merchants Secur Co Ltd			2023-08-15	WOS:001021304600001

First we extend the shape-from-shading problem to deal with perspective projection and near point light sources that are not co-located with the camera center. Secondly we propose a multi-image framework which can align partial shapes obtained from different images in the world coordinates by tracking the endoscope. An iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm is used to improve the matching and recover complete occluding boundaries of the bone. Finally, a complete and consistent shape is obtained by simultaneously re-growing the surface normals and depths in all views. In order to fulfill our shape-from-shading algorithm, we also calibrate both geometry and photometry for an oblique-viewing endoscope that are not well addressed before in the previous literatures. We demonstrate the accuracy of our technique using simulations and experiments with artificial bones.

However, conventional distributed frameworks encounter challenges in identifying appropriate subblock partitioning methods. To address this problem, we propose a novel distributed incipient fault detection method, called CMPSP-MKPCA, based on causal relationship multi-perspective subblock partitioning (CMPSP) and modified kernel principal component analysis (MKPCA), facilitating incipient fault detection in large-scale nonlinear processes. Firstly, considering the property of incipient faults to undergo limited propagation among process flow connections, we obtain fine-grainehe direction of potential incipient fault information propagation. Secondly, the design of multi-perspective detection blocks provides real-time selection of sub-block delineation results to adapt to the different needs of incipient faults during latency and transition periods. Thirdly, local detection is realized by combining the Modified KPCA method and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), while the global detection statistics is obtained by Bayesian inference fusion. Simulation experiments based on the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) system verify the effectiveness and superiority of the method.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0957-5820	1744-3598										Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Software, 127 Youyi St West, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R ChinaNorthwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, 127 Youyi St West, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China				2024-05-24	WOS:001225771600001

Vertical integration refers to the full connection of smart factory levels from the work centers on the shop floor up to the business layer. Horizontal integration is realised when a single smart factory participates in multiple interleaved supply chains with different roles (e.g., main producer, supplier), sharing data and services and forming a Cyber Physical Production Network. In such an interconnected world, data and services become fundamental elements in the cyberspace to implement advanced data-driven applications such as production scheduling, energy consumption optimisation, anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, change management in Product Lifecycle Management, process monitoring and so forth. In this paper, we propose a methodology that guides the design of a portfolio of data-oriented services in a Cyber Physical Production Network. The methodology starts from the goals of the actors in the network, as well as their requirements on data and functions. Therefore, a data model is designed to represent the information shared across actors according to three interleaved perspectives, namely, product, process and industrial assets. Finally, multi-perspective data-oriented services for collecting, monitoring, dispatching and displaying data are built on top of the data model, according to the three perspectives. The methodology also includes a set of access policies for the actors in order to enable controlled access to data and services. The methodology is tested on a real case study for the production of valves in deep and ultra-deep water applications. Experimental validation in the real case study demonstrates the benefits of providing a methodological support for the design of multi-perspective data-oriented services in Cyber Physical Production Networks, both in terms of usability of the data navigation through the services and in terms of service performances in presence of Big Data.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2364-1185	2364-1541										Univ Brescia, Dept Comp Sci, Via Branze 38, Brescia, Italy				2022-08-26	WOS:000842141700001

Most large and complex software packages partitioned across multiple portals and involve many users - each with their role in the software package; those users have different perspectives on the software package, defined by their knowledge, responsibilities, and commitments. Thus, a multi-perspective approach has been used in usability evaluation to overcome the challenge of inconsistency between users' perspectives; the inconsistency challenge would lead to an ill-advised decision on the selection of a suitable OSS. This study aimed to assist the public and private organizations in evaluating and selecting the most suitable OSS. The evaluation of the OSS software packages to choose the best one is a challenging task owing to (a) multiple evaluation criteria, (b) criteria importance, and (c) data variation; thus, it is considered a sophisticated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem; moreover, the multi-perspective usability evaluation framework for OSS selection lacks in the current literature. Hence, this study proposes a novel multi-perspective usability evaluation framework for the selection of OSS based on the multi-criteria analysis. Integration of best-worst method (BWM) and VIKOR MCDM techniques has been used for weighting and ranking OSS alternatives. BWM is utilized for weighting of evaluation criteria, whereas VIKOR is applied to rank OSS-LMS alternatives. Individual and group decision-making contexts, and the internal and external groups aggregation were used to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. A well-organized algorithmic procedure is presented in detail, and a case study was examined to illustrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed framework. The results demonstrated that BWM and VIKOR integration works effectively to solve the OSS software package benchmarking/selection problems. Furthermore, the ranks of OSS software packages obtained from the VIKOR internal and external group decision making were similar; the best OSS-LMS based on the two ways was 'Moodle' software package. Among the scores of groups in the objective validation, significant differences were identified; this indicated that the ranking results of internal and external VIKOR group decision making were valid, which pointed to the validation of the framework.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0219-6220	1793-6845										Informat Technol Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Comp Sci, Serdang, MalaysiaFSKIK Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Dept Comp, Tanjung Malim, Malaysia	Informat Technol Univ Putra MalaysiaFSKIK Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris			2023-02-26	WOS:000925645400007

Polynomial, and even strongly polynomial, algorithms for the standard scheduling problem, in which all jobs are assumed to be distinct, become exponential for the corresponding high multiplicity problem. In this paper, we study various high multiplicity problems of scheduling unit-time jobs on a single machine. We provide strongly polynomial algorithms for constructing optimal schedules with respect to several measures of efficiency (completion time, lateness, tardiness, the number of tardy jobs and their weighted counterparts). The algorithms require a number of operations that are polynomial in the number of groups rather than in the total number of jobs. As a by-product, we identify a new family of nxn transportation problems which are solvable in O(n log n) time by a simple greedy algorithm.									58	0	0	0	0	0	60			0030-364X											RUTGERS STATE UNIV,RUTCOR DIMACS,NEW BRUNSWICK,NJ 08903				1991-07-01	WOS:A1991GC36100011

Special emphasis is paid to the investigation of the dynamics and outcome with regard to the structure and management of the relationships along the multi-tier. A multiple case study method is applied to explain the impact of I4.0 based on a theory-grounded research framework through the lens of complementary SCM theories. Building on qualitative in-depth interviews with 19 experts in managerial positions, three cases from the manufacturing industry involving an I4.0 implementation across the multi-tier were analyzed. This research demonstrates an intensification of synergistic combinations of inter-firm resources, emphasizing SCG as essential.With the implementation of I4.0, competitive advantage along the multi-tier takes higher priority over the competitive advantage in the individual or dyadic perspective. Relational governance mechanisms evolve, allowing competitive advantage as a multi-tier balancing out traditional power mechanisms within the supply chain hierarchy. Findings show that contractual governance mechanisms are limited in their effect, revealing the need for an evolution of "relational contracting." Finally, the case research proposes "agility" as an extended mechanism in SCG research. The study offers in-depth insights into the structure of SCG mechanisms and the implications of adapted SCG on SCM outcomes to redesign multi-tier relationships. Supported by SCM theories and the dimensions of SCG, this paper contributes to the first insights beyond the dyadic perspective, providing an integrated multi-tier perspective while discussing specific mechanisms and identifying relevant propositions for future research.									14	0	0	0	0	1	14			0925-5273	1873-7579										Friedrich Alexander Univ Nuremberg, Chair Supply Chain Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, GermanyFriedrich Alexander Univ Nuremberg, Chair Supply Chain Management, Erlangen, Germany	Friedrich Alexander Univ NurembergFriedrich Alexander Univ Nuremberg			2023-05-21	WOS:000984544200001

Ethical decision-making is a unique aspect of such socio-cognitive systems. In situations that require deliberation over a multitude of options with ethical implications, moral dilemmas are often resolved by a range of heuristics and principles that view the situation from different perspectives. While constraint and utility-driven decision-making strategies are customary in agent-based models, the incompatibility among multiple perspectives can invalidate the underlying premises of models of probabilistic utility-based decisions that rely on classic Kolmogorov axioms. In this paper, we highlight the fallacies of such models and present a practical case study to demonstrate how quantum cognition models can provide an alternative and credible representation of decision-making behaviour in simulations that involve ethical dilemmas.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1747-7778	1747-7786										Auburn Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Auburn, AL 36849 USA				2019-06-14	WOS:000469633200001

This formula, when evaluated at q = 1, gives the multiplicity of a weight in a highest weight representation of a simple Lie algebra. In this paper, we consider the Lie algebra sl(4)(C) and give closed formulas for the q-analog of Kostant's weight multiplicity. This formula depends on the following two sets of results. First, we present closed formulas for the q-analog of Kostant's partition function by counting restricted colored integer partitions. These formulas, when evaluated at q = 1, recover results of De Loera and Sturmfels. Second, we describe and enumerate the Weyl alternation sets, which consist of the elements of the Weyl group that contribute nontrivially to Kostant's weight multiplicity formula. From this, we introduce Weyl alternation diagrams on the root lattice of sl(4)(C), which are associated to the Weyl alternation sets.

Scholars have explored ways through which configurations of technologies, infrastructures, social practices, institutions and markets can change to fulfil their functions in a more sustainable way. A multi-level perspective (MLP) has been developed to describe and analyse these complex, long-term processes. It has also been used to help design policy for example in the Netherlands. In this paper the MLP is used in a novel way: as a heuristic to ex ante assess policies to stimulate socio-technical transitions. Instead of using it for policy development, the MLP is used here for an assessment of policy. The analysis focuses on a particular policy initiative intended to stimulate the transition to a low carbon economy in the UK: the Carbon Trust. This paper makes two contributions to the socio-technical transitions literature: Conceptually, the paper demonstrates the usefulness of the socio-technical multi-level perspective to analyse policies and assess their likely impact ex ante against the background of theorising about the patterns of large scale, socio-technical change. Empirically, the paper finds that the activities of the Carbon Trust consist of a variety of well targeted ways to stimulate the development of socio-technical niches as well as to change regime practices directly. Nevertheless, the paper argues that this model also faces difficulties in promoting a transition towards a low carbon economy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In order to help brands find suitable micro-influencers as marketing partners, the micro-influencer recommendation is regarded as an indispensable part of influencer marketing. However, previous works only focus on modeling the individual image of brands/micro-influencers, which is insufficient to represent the characteristics of brands/micro-influencers over the marketing scenarios. In this case, we propose a micro-influencer ranking joint learning framework which models brands/micro-influencers from the perspective of individual image, target audiences, and cooperation preferences. Specifically, to model accounts' individual image, we extract topics information and images semantic information from historical content information, and fuse them to learn the account content representation. We introduce target audiences as a new kind of marketing role in the micro-influencer recommendation, in which audiences information of brand/micro-influencer is leveraged to learn the multi-modal account audiences representation. Afterward, we build the attribute co-occurrence graph network to mine cooperation preferences from social media interaction information. Based on account attributes, the cooperation preferences between brands and micro-influencers are refined to attributes' co-occurrence information. The attribute node embeddings learned in the attribute co-occurrence graph network are further utilized to construct the account attribute representation. Finally, the global ranking function is designed to generate ranking scores for all brand-micro-influencer pairs from the three perspectives jointly. The extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art methods.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1520-9210	1941-0077										Shandong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R ChinaAnt Financial Serv Grp, Hangzhou 310013, Peoples R China				2023-08-07	WOS:001030640600023

The study on user preference model has adapted simple user preference model, which determines a set of preferred keywords or topic, and weights to each target. In this paper, we recommend multi-perspective user preference model that factors sentiment information in the model.

J	Hwang, Jae Seong; Lee, Ji-Yung; Chun, Hyunchae					Lee, Ji-Yung/0009-0001-8398-1443					Ego-Satellite Perspective Multi-PAT Configurations for Optical Inter-Satellite Links								IEEE ACCESS				12				144412	144419				10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3469889							Article	2024	2024	Efforts are being made to commercialize optical inter-satellite links (O-ISL) in low earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks as it is a crucial technology for next-generation communication networks. However, installing the pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) modules is vital due to the long link distances among the fast-orbiting satellites. This research investigates the configurations of multiple PAT modules (multi-PAT) and the tradeoff between data-rate and latency, considering practical constraints such as link distance back-off and the atmospheric bypass. An ego-centric coordinate conversion method facilitates the field-of-view analysis from an ego-satellite perspective optimization of the multi-PAT. Simulation results suggest that around 70% of angular coverage around the ego-satellite through the multi-PAT allows reliable O-ISLs. The link distance back-off constraining the maximum distance of an individual link sensitively governs the number of hops, but the total O-ISL path distance is less affected. Regarding the atmospheric bypass restricting the lowest altitude for each link, the side-effect is insignificant even when the atmosphere up to 100 km from the ground is bypassed. The communication and latency performances are in a tradeoff relationship since the per-link distance and the number of hops are inversely related in O-ISLs. The individual link distance significantly affects the channel loss, and the number of hops directly influences latency. Depending on the multi-PAT configurations, an O-ISL system with similar to 10 Gb/s within similar to 200 ms can be established from New York to Seoul.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2169-3536											Incheon Natl Univ, Dept Informat & Telecommun Engn, Incheon 22012, South Korea				2024-10-25	WOS:001336084400001

In this study, a novel ensemble learning framework for gait recognition, namely multi-perspective gait recognition based on classifier fusion is proposed. Firstly, by utilising bidirectional optical flow, a new algorithm for gait feature extraction is presented, which adaptively extracts the dynamic gait characteristics of walking persons. Secondly, two base classifiers, namely the support vector machine and the hidden Markov model, are trained using the extracted dynamic gait features and traditional gait energy images separately. Thirdly, a novel algorithm is presented for combining two types of base gait classifiers together on the decision level. Finally, the proposed framework by two experiments on the well-known CASIA and OU-ISIR gait databases is evaluated, respectively, and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed methods in comparison with others.									5	0	0	0	0	0	6			1751-9659	1751-9667										China Jiliang Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, 258 Xueyuan St, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2019-10-09	WOS:000487789000009

I show that when single district elections are used to fill a legislature, we get back to a world where the median voter matters. An extreme policy will generally only come about if it is preferred to a more moderate policy by the median voter in a majority of districts. The mere existence of a centrist party can lead to moderate outcomes even if the party itself wins few seats. I also show that, while some voters in a district will not vote for their nationally preferred party, in many equilibria they will want the candidate for whom they vote to win that district. This is never the case in single district elections. There, some voters always want the candidate they voted for to lose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies typically address specific weakly supervised scenarios independently, such as Multi-label Learning with Missing Labels (MLML) and Partial Multi-label Learning (PML), which limits their generality. In this paper, we adopt a unified perspective across diverse weak supervision settings and propose a general loss function framework that is broadly applicable. Furthermore, we argue that a well-designed loss function not only mitigates label noise with low computational cost but also demonstrates strong extensibility. Specifically, we focus on the most challenging Single Positive Multi-label Learning (SPML) scenario, where each sample is annotated with only one positive label. The properties and hyperparameter update strategy of our SPML loss are investigated, and theoretical insights are provided through pseudo-label risk and gradient analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and the real-world RFMiD 2.0 dataset demonstrate the superiority and practical effectiveness of our method, achieving significant improvements over existing approaches across various weak supervision settings.

Such a model requires a firm grasp of the abstract principles on which a system is based, as well as an understanding of the high-level nature of the representation of entities and processes. In this context, models can have distinct architectural characteristics. This paper discusses model multiplicity (e.g., unified modeling language [UML]), model singularity (e.g., object-process methodology [OPM], thinging machine [TM]), and a heterogeneous model that involves multiplicity and singularity. The basic idea of model multiplicity is that it is not possible to present all views in a single representation, so a number of models are used, with each model representing a different view. The model singularity approach uses only a single unified model that assimilates its subsystems into one system. This paper is concerned with current approaches, especially in software engineering texts, where multimodal UML is introduced as the general-purpose modeling language (i.e., UML is modeling). In such a situation, we suggest raising the issue of multiplicity versus singularity in modeling. This would foster a basic appreciation of the UML advantages and difficulties that may be faced during modeling, especially in the educational setting. Furthermore, we advocate the claim that a multiplicity of views does not necessitate a multiplicity of models. The model singularity approach can represent multiple views (static, behavior) without resorting to a collection of multiple models with various notations. We present an example of such a model where the static representation is developed first. Then, the dynamic view and behavioral representations are built by incorporating a decomposition strategy interleaved with the notion of time.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1738-7906											Kuwait Univ, Comp Engn Dept, Kuwait, Kuwait				2021-06-08	WOS:000651640000015

Such sensor data from disparate sources can be aggregated and inferences can be made about the user, the user's physical activities as well as the physical activities of the group the user is part of. A perspective on this is that the group's physical activity becomes an explanation for the sensor readings now obtained from this set of sensors. This paper proposes an explanation-based perspective on reasoning about multi-device sensor data, and describes a framework called GroupSense that prototypes this idea.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0933-1875	1610-1987										Deakin Univ, Sch Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3125, AustraliaLa Trobe Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia				2018-02-19	WOS:000424411300006

However, the large number of courses and multiple factors affecting students' course grades makes it difficult to reveal and analyze the complicated relationship between the two types of courses only from a single perspective or at a single level. Thence, this paper starts with analysis of historical course grades data within an undergraduate program and then presents an interactive visual analytic system, MVCAS, which is designed to demonstrate and explore the various correlations between these two types of courses at different levels and from different perspectives. The major contributions of this work include: (1) a multi-angle preprocessing of course grades data, including decomposition, extraction and conversion; (2) multiple coordinated analysis views which make it possible to effectively explore the overall, categorical and pairwise course correlations and further link courses with students, instructors and semesters together; and (3) a top-down correlation analysis process for general courses and program ones. The effectiveness and usefulness of MVCAS have been preliminarily demonstrated through a case study, in which the field experts use this tool to investigate different levels of correlations between the focused mathematics and program-specific courses in a computer science major comprehensively.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0178-2789	1432-2315										China Univ Petr, Beijing Key Lab Petr Data Min, Dept Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChina Mobile Commun Co Ltd, Res Inst, Beijing, Peoples R China				2020-03-31	WOS:000520062800001

The MAS has the hypothesis that the agent based computing offers better approach to manage the complex systems and process. They are large-scale systems and collaborate with one another to achieve their functions in a highly modular and flexible way. In this point of view, the work presented in this paper is an enhanced attempt to validate the MAS based on application perspective. As a test-bed, a distributed MAS for software testing is constructed such that to provide a hybrid testing environment based on variety of agents, which possibly incorporate several testing techniques. The developed framework is validated on two perspectives namely, efficiency of the application domain, i.e. software testing using MAS and efficiency of the proposed framework. The validation of the later case has been carried out on two conditions: regular working environment and exceptional working environment. The second type of validation provided the guidelines for implementing proper exception handling mechanism in the enhanced MAS, which is being developed for software testing Purpose.

Different studies have analysed a wide range of use cases and scenarios for using IT-based services in homecare settings for elderly people. In most instances, the impact of such services has been studied using a one-dimensional approach, either focusing on the benefits for the patient or health service provider.Purpose. The objective of this contribution is to explore a model for identifying and understanding outcomes of IT-based homecare services from a multi-actor perspective.Methods. In order to better understand the state of the art in homecare informatics, we conducted a literature review. We use experiences from previous research in the area of informatics to develop the proposed model.Results. The proposed model consists of four core activities 'identify involved actors', 'understand consequences', 'clarify contingencies', 'take corrective actions', and one additional activity 'brainstorming IT use'.Conclusion. The primary goal of innovating organisations, processes and services in homecare informatics today, is to offer continued care, better decision support both to practitioners and patients, as well as effective distribution of resources.

Unfortunately, many XML documents in practice are not accompanied by a (valid) schema. Therefore, it is essential to devise algorithms to infer schemas from XML documents, where the fundamental task is learning regular expressions. In this paper, we focus on the learning of disjunctive multiplicity expressions (DMEs), a subclass of regular expressions that are particularly suitable to specify unordered models and have been used as the foundation of the schemas for unordered XML. Previous work for learning DME lacks inference algorithms that support positive and negative examples. Further, presently there has been no algorithm can learn DMEs extended with numeric occurrences. We address these challenges in the present paper and first propose a novel algorithm to learn DMEs from positive and negative examples by using genetic algorithms and parallel techniques. Then we extend DMEs to disjunctive generalized multiplicity expressions (DGMEs), which allow numeric occurrences and develop an algorithm to learn DGMEs from positive and negative examples. Finally, experimental results show that with only positive examples, our algorithm can generate a DME with an acceptable learning time, which can accept all positive examples, and when given both positive and negative examples, we can learn DMEs or DGMEs with high accuracy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-4620	1460-2067										Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Software, State Key Lab Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China				2022-04-29	WOS:000784603700001

Multiple perspectives provide a useful invariant feature of object in image, i.e., the footage area on the ground. Moving objects are detected in image domain, and tracking results of the objects are represented in projection domain using planar homography. Spatio-temporal relationships between human and vehicle tracks are categorized to safe or unsafe situation depending on site context such as walkway and driveway locations. Semantic-level information of the situation is achieved with the anticipation of possible directions of near-future tracks using piecewise velocity history. Crowd density is estimated from the footage in homography plane. Experimental data show promising results. Our framework can be applied to broad range of situational awareness for emergency response, disaster prevention, human interactions in structured environments, and crowd movement analysis in wide-view areas.

Mode-based estimators (MBE) are one of the most popular types of estimators used in univariable-MR studies and is often used as a sensitivity analysis for pleiotropy. However, because there are no plurality valid regression estimators, modal estimators for multivariable-MR have been under-explored.Methods We use the residual framework for multivariable-MR to introduce two multivariable modal estimators: multivariable-MBE, which uses IVW to create residuals fed into a traditional plurality valid estimator, and an estimator which instead has the residuals fed into the contamination mixture method (CM), multivariable-CM. We then use Monte-Carlo simulations to explore the performance of these estimators when compared to existing ones and re-analyse the data used by Grant and Burgess (2021) looking at the causal effect of intelligence, education, and household income on Alzheimer's disease as an applied example.Results In our simulation, we found that multivariable-MBE was generally too variable to be much use. Multivariable-CM produced more precise estimates on the other hand. Multivariable-CM performed better than MR-Egger in almost all settings, and Weighted Median under balanced pleiotropy. However, it underperformed Weighted Median when there was a moderate amount of directional pleiotropy. Our re-analysis supported the conclusion of Grant and Burgess (2021), that intelligence had a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease, while education, and household income do not have a causal effect.Conclusions Here we introduced two, non-regression-based, plurality valid estimators for multivariable MR. Of these, "multivariable-CM" which uses IVW to create residuals fed into a contamination-mixture model, performed the best. This estimator uses a plurality of variants valid assumption, and appears to provide precise and unbiased estimates in the presence of balanced pleiotropy and small amounts of directional pleiotropy.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1932-6203											Univ Bristol, Sch Psychol Sci, Bristol, EnglandUniv Bristol, MRC Integrat Epidemiol Unit, Bristol, EnglandUniv Cambridge, MRC Biostat Unit, Cambridge, EnglandImperial Coll London, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, London, EnglandUniv Sydney, Fac Med & Hlth, Sydney Sch Publ Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia				2024-07-12	WOS:001221690000019	38713711

For e-tail companies with limited financial resources, customer-company communications, instead of using visual simulation, are based mostly on text (e. g., product attributes, company information). This study explores the influence of text-based e-tail content on virtual presence and the mechanism underlying this influence by testing (1) the effect of cue multiplicity on telepresence and social presence and (2) the dynamics of how presence perceptions affect decision affirmation. A total of 407 participants in the main experiment were exposed to a fictitious e-tail Web site, and the cue multiplicity of the text-based e-tail content was manipulated. The results supported all the hypotheses but one. First, a greater number of cues led to greater perception of telepresence and social presence, providing support for the hypothesized effect of cue multiplicity in text-based e-tail content on virtual presence. Second, telepresence increased Web site trust, ultimately contributing to shoppers' decision affirmation; however, the effect of telepresence on e-shopping enjoyment was not confirmed. Finally, social presence significantly improved Web site trust, e-shopping enjoyment, and social affirmation, all of which improved decision affirmation. The findings illuminate the role of cue multiplicity in e-tail text as a crucial antecedent to virtual presence and decision affirmation. A strategic manipulation of e-tail text should be further considered by managers of various virtual marketplaces as a cost-efficient and effective way of helping the shopper's decision process.									44	1	0	0	0	1	50			1086-4415	1557-9301										Kookmin Univ Korea, Seoul, South KoreaHankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea				2014-07-23	WOS:000337897600006

However, T-staging via manual slice-by-slice inspection is time-consuming while tumor sizes and shapes are heterogeneous, and junior physicians find such inspection challenging. With inspiration from oncological diagnostics, we developed a multi-perspective aggregation network that incorporated various diagnosis-oriented knowledge which allowed automated nasopharyngeal carcinoma T-staging detection (TSD Net). Specifically, our TSD Net was designed in multi-branch architecture, which can capture tumor size and shape information (basic knowledge), strongly correlated contextual features, and associations between the tumor and surrounding tissues. We defined the association between the tumor and surrounding tissues by a signed distance map which can embed points and tumor contours in higher-dimensional spaces, yielding valuable information regarding the locations of tissue associations. TSD Net finally outputs a T1-T4 stage prediction by aggregating data from the three branches. We evaluated TSD Net by using the T1-weighted contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging database of 320 patients in a three-fold cross-validation manner. The results show that the proposed method achieves a mean area under the curve (AUC) as high as 87.95%. We also compared our method to traditional classifiers and a deep learning-based method. Our TSD Net is efficient and accurate and outperforms other methods.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0031-9155	1361-6560										Southern Med Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Med Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Med Image Proc, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Med Univ, Guangdong Prov Engn Lab Med Imaging & Diagnost Tec, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Med Imaging Ctr, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSouthern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Radiat Oncol, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China				2022-12-24	WOS:000895405200001	36541557

Automated vehicles and, more specifically, automated minibuses integrated into mobility systems are analysed in this study as a breakthrough technology through the perspective of different stakeholder groups and citizens. Our research approach builds upon conceptual mapping and semi-structured interviews with main stakeholder groups (n = 30) and a large-scale survey with citizens of four European cities (n = 1816). This paper brings forward insights into the interaction between technology and society as a dialectical process through the prism of socio-technical transitions and multi-level perspectives. The study addresses the main drivers and barriers to steering the deployment of automated minibuses to meet the mobility needs of citizens and the aims of cities towards sustainable mobility. Further, it points out five main mechanisms to pave the way to a mobility transition with automated minibuses integrated into mobility systems. Our findings support the prospect that automated minibuses integrated into public transport and MaaS systems and coupled with other niche innovations and policy instruments can be part of the solution to pave the way towards a socio-technical transition to a new mobility paradigm.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8			0040-1625	1873-5509										Pforzheim Univ, Tiefenbronner Str 65, D-75175 Pforzheim, GermanyUniv Paris Saclay, Lab Genie Ind, Cent Supelec, 9 Rue Joliot Curie, F-91190 Gif Sur Yvette, FranceFraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Breslauerstr 48, D-76139 Karlsruhe, Germany	Pforzheim Univ			2023-02-20	WOS:000923289600001

Several perspectives, such as inhomogeneous foggy, homogenous foggy, and dark foggy scenes, have been considered in multicriteria evaluation. The benchmarking for the selection of the best image dehazing intelligent algorithm based on multi-criteria perspectives is a challenging task owing to (a) multiple evaluation criteria, (b) criteria importance, (c) data variation, (d) criteria conflict, and (e) criteria tradeoff. A generally accepted framework for benchmarking image dehazing performance is unavailable in the existing literature. This study proposes a novel multi-perspective (i.e., an inhomogeneous foggy scene, a homogenous foggy scene, and a dark foggy scene) benchmarking framework for the selection of the best image dehazing intelligent algorithm based on multi-criteria analysis. Experiments were conducted in three stages. First was an evaluation experiment with five algorithms as part of matrix data. Second was a crossover between image dehazing intelligent algorithms and a set of target evaluation criteria to obtain matrix data. Third was the ranking of the image dehazing intelligent algorithms through integrated best-worst and VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje methods. Individual and group decision-making contexts were applied to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework. The mean was used to objectively validate the ranks given by group decision-making contexts. Checklist and benchmarking scenarios were provided to compare the proposed framework with an existing benchmark study. The proposed framework achieved a significant result in terms of selecting the best image dehazing algorithm.									65	0	0	0	2	0	66			0219-6220	1793-6845										Univ Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Dept Comp, Tanjong Malim, Perak, MalaysiaUniv Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fac Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Batu Pahat 86400, Johor, MalaysiaAl Muthanna Univ, Coll Agr, Samawah 66001, IraqUniv Mosul, Coll Adm & Econ, Mosul, IraqTikrit Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Comp Sci & Math Coll, Tikrit 34001, Iraq				2020-07-14	WOS:000543735100008

Social relation has been conceptualized in terms of how organizational relationships with social entities facilitate and/or inhibit organizational learning. In particular, we examine how two different relational structures single vendor dominant model and multi-vendor dominant model are associated with two types of organizational learning, namely, exploitative and exploratory. Furthermore, we investigate how three critical dimensions structural (core vs. non-core functions), affective (partnership vs. transaction), and cognitive (business value vs. IT capability) in social relation affect the relationships between the two relational structures and the two types of organizational learning in the context of IT outsourcing. The proposed hypotheses were tested using 203 Korean client firms that have adopted the multi-vendor approach in IT outsourcing. Results reveal that the single vendor dominant model exerts a more significant effect on exploitative learning than exploratory learning. By contrast, the multi-vendor dominant model has a more significant effect on the latter than the former. Furthermore, out of the six moderating variables, four (core IT function, non-core IT function, partnership relationship, and transaction relationship) have significant influences on exploitative and exploratory, learning. We conclude with theoretical contributions in the area of social relation theory and IT outsourcing literature, and implications for practices on how clients can enhance engagement in exploitative and exploratory learning to reap the benefits of multi-vendor outsourcing.

For any number of alternatives and at least four voters, we find sufficient conditions for the game to be dominance-solvable (DS) and not to be DS. These conditions can be stated in terms of only one aspect of the game, the largest proportion of voters who agree on which alternative is worst in a sequence of subsets of the original set of alternatives. When the number of voters is large, "almost all" games can be classified as either DS or not DS. When the electorate is sufficiently replicated, then if the game is DS, a Condorcet winner always exists, and the outcome is the Condorcet winner. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Despite its notable performance, we uncover three decisive shortcomings in its current design, including semantic ambiguity, inappropriate sampling, and insufficient utilization of depth supervision. To combat the aforementioned problems, we present three corresponding solutions: 1) Semantic Enhancement. We project the freely available 3D segmentation annotations onto the 2D plane and leverage the corresponding 2D semantic maps as the supervision signal, significantly enhancing the semantic awareness of multi-view detectors. 2) Perspective-Aware Sampling. Instead of employing the uniform sampling strategy, we put forward the perspective-aware sampling policy that samples densely near the camera while sparsely in the distance, more effectively collecting the valuable geometric clues. 3) Ordinal Residual Depth Supervision. As opposed to directly regressing the depth values that are difficult to optimize, we divide the depth range of each scene into a fixed number of ordinal bins and reformulate the depth prediction as the combination of the classification of depth bins as well as the regression of the residual depth values, thereby benefiting the depth learning process. The resulting algorithm, NeRF-Det++, has exhibited appealing performance in the ScanNetV2 and ARKITScenes datasets. Notably, in ScanNetV2, NeRF-Det++ outperforms the competitive NeRF-Det by +1.9% in mAP @0.25 and +3.5% in mAP @0.50.

We consider the problem in the context of matrix proof methods for classical higher-order logic and present a technique which improves the standard practice of iterative deepening over the multiplicities. We present a mechanism that allows to adjust multiplicities on demand during matrix-based proof search and not only preserves existing substitutions and connections, but additionally adapts them to the parts that result from the increase of the multiplicities.

Let s(lambda) be a part size chosen uniformly at random from the set of all part sizes that occur in lambda. We prove that, for every fixed m greater than or equal to 1, the probability that s(lambda) has multiplicity m in A approaches 1/(m(m + 1)) as n ---> infinity. Thus, for example, the limiting probability that a random part size in a random partition is unrepeated is 1/2. In addition, (a) for the average number of different part sizes, we refine an asymptotic estimate given by Wilf, (b) we derive an asymptotic estimate of the average number of parts of given multiplicity m, and (c) we show that the expected multiplicity of a randomly chosen part size of a random partition of n is asymptotic to (log n)/2. The proofs of the main result and of (c) use a conditioning device of Fristedt.

Prompt-based learning (i.e., discrete prompting and prompt tuning) achieves promising results in low-resource scenarios by adapting a pre-trained model to handle new tasks. However, these approaches suffer performance degradation when the target task involves a textual domain (e.g., a political domain) different from the pre-training task (e.g., masked language modeling on a general corpus). In this paper, we develop a novel multi-stage prompt tuning framework for political perspective detection. Our method involves two sequential stages: a domain- and task-specific prompt tuning stage. In the first stage, we tune the domain-specific prompts based on a masked political phrase prediction (MP3) task to adjust the language model to the political domain. In the second task-specific prompt tuning stage, we only tune task-specific prompts with a frozen language model and domain-specific prompts for downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms fine-tuning (i.e., model tuning) methods and state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on the SemEval-2019 Task 4: Hyperpartisan News Detection and AllSides datasets.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2076-3417										Catholic Univ Korea, Dept Data Sci, Bucheon 14662, South KoreaCatholic Univ Korea, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Bucheon 14662, South KoreaKorea Univ, Dept Artificial Intelligence, Seoul 02841, South KoreaKorea Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea				2023-06-11	WOS:000995527500001

Experiments with a feed mixture of glucose and pyruvate show multiple steady state behavior as predicted by the cybernetic model. When multiplicity occurs at a dilution (growth) rate, it results in hysteretic behavior following switches in dilution rate from above and below. This phenomenon is caused by transient paths leading to different steady states through dynamic maximization of the carbon uptake rate. Thus steady state multiplicity is a manifestation of the nonlinearity arising from cybernetic mechanisms rather than of the nonlinear kinetics. The predicted metabolic multiplicity would extend to intracellular states such as enzyme levels and fluxes to be verified in future experiments.

The review includes 75 peer-reviewed papers that span a broad range of energy-demanding systems and mainly build upon the core frameworks of the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) and Technological Innovation Systems (TIS). The analysis identifies three key aspects to consider in multi-system frameworks. The first aspect is the importance of considering the overarching directionality of multiple sociotechnical systems and how they influence each other. The second is to explicitly analyse the phase of each transitioning system. The third aspect is a need for explicit system configuration analysis. This includes analysing the value chain and the number and types of sectors linked to it, typifying the distinct characteristics of sectors internally and how they interact, and analysing complementary or competitive technologies. The paper concludes by providing recommendations for future research, with a particular focus on the further development of new multi-system frameworks that include one or more of the prior-mentioned three key takeaways. Firstly, focusing on dynamics within multi-system niches. Secondly, performing actor-level analysis, including demand-side analysis. Finally, applying quantitative methods, such as computer simulation modelling.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0040-1625	1873-5509										Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, NetherlandsUniv Cent Florida, Dept Civil Environm & Construct Engn, 12800 Pegasus Dr 211, Orlando, FL 32816 USA				2024-03-29	WOS:001188340900001

Two papers by Mulmuley and Sohoni [K. D. Mulmuley and M. Sohoni, SIAM J. Comput., 31 (2001), pp. 496-526; SIAM J. Comput., 38 (2008), pp. 1175-1206] pursue this goal via representation theoretic multiplicities in coordinate rings of specific group varieties. The papers also conjecture that the vanishing behavior of these multiplicities would be sufficient to separate complexity classes (so-called occurrence obstructions). The existence of such strong occurrence obstructions was recently disproved in 2016 in two successive papers, [C. Ikenmeyer and G. Panova, Adv. Math., 319 (2017), pp. 40-66] and [P. Burgisser, C. Ikenmeyer, and G. Panova, J. Amer. Math. Soc., 32 (2019), pp. 163-193]. This raises the question of whether separating group varieties via representation theoretic multiplicities is stronger than separating them via occurrences. This paper provides for the first time a setting where separating with multiplicities can be achieved, while separation with occurrences is provably impossible. Our setting is surprisingly simple and natural: We study the variety of products of homogeneous linear forms (the so-called Chow variety) and the variety of polynomials of bounded border Waring rank (i.e., a higher secant variety of the Veronese variety). As a side result we prove a slight generalization of Hermite's reciprocity theorem, which proves Foulkes's conjecture for a new infinite family of cases.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2470-6566											Saarland Univ, D-66123 Saarbrucken, GermanyUniv Liverpool, Dept Comp Sci, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, EnglandMax Planck Inst Software Syst, Saarbrucken, GermanyMax Planck Inst Informat, Saarbrucken, GermanySimons Inst Theory Comp, Berkeley, CA USAUniv Southern Calif, Dept Math, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USAUniv Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA	Simons Inst Theory Comp			2020-07-16	WOS:000545939200004

In this paper, we focus on predicting emotions in the public online blogs from different people, by extracting as many reasonable emotions for each blog sentence as possible. Concretely, we consider three different perspectives for analyzing the multiple emotions in a sentence: (i) predict sentence emotions by examining the emotion related topics in a global sense; (ii) predict the sentence emotions from the context-sensitive word emotions; and (iii) predict sentence emotions by considering the emotional significance in the local bag of words. We build different probabilistic models from each perspective, to separately generate the sentence emotion probabilities. We then integrate these probabilistic models to jointly predict the emotion probabilities. Because the component models are based on different emotional assumptions with distinct features, the integrated predictions should predict emotions from more general perspectives and therefore yield better results. In the experiment, we employ different evaluation criteria to compare the multi-emotion predictions from the single and integrated models. Compared to the results in the baseline model, our bi-integrated models achieve 8.69% higher Micro F1 and 7.78% higher Macro F1 scores, on average. Moreover, our tri-integrated model acquires 10.00% higher Micro F1 and 9.19% higher Macro F1 scores than the baseline results, which proves our assumption, and suggests interesting features in the different emotion perspectives.

We hypothesize that the visual system optimizes multiple cost functions of unrelated tasks and this causes the emergence of a ventral pathway dedicated to vision for perception, and a dorsal pathway dedicated to vision for action.To evaluate the functional organization in multi-task deep neural networks, we propose a method that measures the contribution of a unit towards each task, applying it to two networks that have been trained on either two related or two unrelated tasks, using an identical stimulus set. Results show that the network trained on the unrelated tasks shows a decreasing degree of feature representation sharing towards higher-tier layers while the network trained on related tasks uniformly shows high degree of sharing.We conjecture that the method we propose can be used to analyze the anatomical and functional organization of the visual system and beyond. We predict that the degree to which tasks are related is a good descriptor of the degree to which they share downstream cortical-units. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the studies on learning theory for general loss functions and hypothesis spaces remain limited. In order to comprehend the properties and behaviors of distributed ERM, we introduce multi-view learning to explore it at a more profound level. In this work, we adopt an innovative perspective by examining the distributed ERM from multi-view, and study the risk performance of distributed ERM for general loss functions and hypothesis spaces. The main theoretical results ar e two-fold. First, we derive two tight risk bounds under certain basic assumptions on the hypothesis space, as wel l as the smoothness, Lipschitz continuity, strong convexity of the loss function. Second, we further develop two more general risk bounds for distributed ERM without the restriction of strong convexity. The present work not only bridges the knowledge deficit in learning theory of distributed ERM for general loss functions and hypothesis spaces, from multi-view sight, it also show s that under certain conditions the number of views can guarantee the performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-2535	1872-6305										Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin, Peoples R ChinaRenmin Univ China, Gaoling Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Key Lab Big Data Management & Anal Methods, Beijing, Peoples R China	Beijing Key Lab Big Data Management & Anal Methods			2023-12-06	WOS:001107193400001

Since the role of a multiplicity in matrix methods is the encoding of the number of copies of a given formula that are needed in order to prove a valid formula, it is important to find upper bounds for multiplicities in order to reduce as much as possible the search space for proofs. Moreover, it is obviously a crucial issue if the matrix method is to be used as a decision method. We exploit previous results establishing upper bounds on the number of contractions in tableau/sequent proofs [4], in order to establish upper bounds for multiplicities in matrix systems.We obtain two kinds of upper bounds: in function of the size of the formula to be proved and in function of the number of the atomic paths through the unindexed formula-tree. Such bounds may be non-optimal. However, the method used to establish them may be useful for obtaining finer upper bounds.

The analytical framework directly measures contributions of the multi scale components to natural gas price fluctuations and further investigates the dynamic relationships between influential factors (such as crude oil prices, weather and natural gas inventories) and each of multi-scale components of regional natural gas prices. The results show: (1) Emergency events and the short-term disequilibrium between market supply and demand have significant impacts on natural gas prices in North America, while in Japan and Europe, trend terms play a leading role in natural gas price fluctuations. (2) Unlike other markets, the North American natural gas market and the international crude oil market have significant interaction mechanisms. Temperature changes in the winter, rather than in the summer, can cause Henry Hub spot prices to fluctuate. (3) Oil prices play the leading role in affecting Asian and European natural gas prices, having advance effects of one to three months and one to six months, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

So there is not a unique operator which can be qualified as the best; on the contrary, there will be a suitable merging operator depending on the goal of the merging process. More concretely, we will propose a set of four composition operators: coproduct(max), coproduct(min), coproduct(maj) and coproduct(maj+inc). They will be evaluated making use of a list of desired algebraic properties proposed by researchers on merging and which should be held by an ideal merging operator. This analysis can help us to compare the different operators, revealing the key features of each, and identifying weaknesses that may require further research. The conclusion drawn after this analysis points out that these properties are not useful enough to adequately characterize a merging operator. Therefore, new properties will be provided in order to complete the previous list and help to define better the behavior of the different merging operators.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0218-1940	1793-6403										Univ Vigo, Telemat Engn Dept, ETSE Telecommun, Vigo 36310, Spain				2008-02-01	WOS:000255159800006

Optimal prioritisation process is critical for successful implementation and release planning in a software development project. Requirement prioritisation becomes more challenging in projects having large sets of requirements and stakeholders, having diverse perspectives resulting in irrelevancy and ambiguity during features extraction. This study aims to improve requirement prioritisation process using text mining and clustering techniques for accurate extraction of features and requirement prioritisation in multi-stakeholder context. The proposed framework developed to avoid incompleteness in requirements and disagreement among development teams and stakeholders. Thus, the proposed framework compared with other requirement prioritisation techniques (i.e. Analytical Heretical Process, Commutative Voting and Wiegers) to highlight the significance of the proposed framework while conducting an experimental study. The results show that the proposed framework outperformed the traditional techniques and enhanced the prioritisation process with complete semantic information of extracted features and taking into account the diverse perspective of stakeholders.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1751-8806	1751-8814										Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agr Univ, Univ Inst Informat Technol, Rawalpindi, PakistanCOMSATS Inst Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Informat & Technol, Islamabad, PakistanImam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Informat Syst, POB 1982, Dammam, Saudi Arabia				2020-10-22	WOS:000576364200003

And the environment of enterprises' behaviors often occurs during durations and dynamics. To explore the optimal marketing and CSR strategies in a dynamic multi-period CLSCN system, this paper investigates the dynamic multi-period CLSCN equilibrium problem considering marketing and CSR. A multi-period CLSCN system includes manufacturers, retailers, recyclers, and demand markets. Based on Nash non-cooperative game theory and variational inequality, we design the optimal behavior and equilibrium conditions of members. Then, a new equilibrium model of a multi-period CLSCN is constructed. In this model, marketing is the responsibility of manufacturers and retailers, and CSR is the responsibility of manufacturers. Numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the model and analyzed to describe how marketing and CSR affect equilibrium results. We find that the retailers are responsible for marketing, and the level of CSR activities of the manufacturers is higher during the early period, which is most beneficial to the multi-period CLSCN system and social welfare. Based on the conclusions of this paper, the management enlightenments from the perspectives of enterprises and government are also proposed.									8	0	0	0	1	0	9			2169-3536											Northeast Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Harbin 150030, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin 150080, Peoples R China				2021-07-21	WOS:000606550800001

The expressiveness hierarchy between these languages is then studied through the notion of modular embedding proposed by De Boer and Palamidessi. Complementing these theoretical study, considerations on the implementation are drawn, which attest that the more expressive a language is, the more expensive is its implementation.

Existing domain adaptation methods that reduce fMRI heterogeneity generally require accessing source domain data, which is challenging due to privacy concerns and/or data storage burdens. To this end, we propose a source-free collaborative domain adaptation (SCDA) framework using only a pretrained source model and unlabeled target data. Specifically, a multi-perspective feature enrichment method (MFE) is developed to dynamically exploit target fMRIs from multiple views. To facilitate efficient source-to-target knowledge transfer without accessing source data, we initialize MFE using parameters of a pretrained source model. We also introduce an unsupervised pretraining strategy using 3,806 unlabeled fMRIs from three largescale auxiliary databases. Experimental results on three public and one private datasets show the efficacy of our method in cross-scanner and cross-study prediction.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0031-3203	1873-5142										Univ N Carolina, Dept Radiol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAUniv N Carolina, Biomed Res Imaging Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USAGuangzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Tradit Chinese Med Hosp, Dept Acupuncture & Rehabil, Guangzhou 510130, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Sch Clin Med 1, Dept Radiol, Guangzhou 510120, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaUniv N Carolina, Dept Neurol, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA				2024-09-15	WOS:001303356700001	39246820

For instance, a non-synonymous position in one transcript could be a synonymous site in another. Alternatively, a position could remain as non-synonymous in multiple transcripts. Here we examined the impact of codon position plurality on the frequency of deleterious single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) using data from 6500 human exomes.Results: Our results showed that the proportion of deleterious SNVs was more than 2-fold higher in positions that remain non-synonymous in multiple transcripts compared with that observed in positions that are non-synonymous in one or some transcript(s) and synonymous or intronic in other(s). Furthermore, we observed a positive relationship between the fraction of deleterious non-synonymous SNVs and the number of proteins (alternative splice variants) affected. These results demonstrate that the plurality of codon positions is an important attribute, which could be useful in identifying mutations associated with diseases.									3	0	0	0	2	0	4			1367-4803	1460-2059										Griffith Univ, Environm Futures Res Inst, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia				2015-03-25	WOS:000350058800001	25282643

However, this task remains challenging because of the variations in hand appearance from different viewpoints and severe occlusions. To effectively address these challenges, this study introduces a novel approach, called the multi-perspective cue-aware joint relationship representation for 3D HPE via the Swin Transformer (MPCTrans, for short). This approach is designed to learn multi-perspective cues and essential information from hand depth images. To achieve this goal, three novel modules are proposed to utilize features from multiple virtual views of the hand, namely, the adaptive virtual multi-viewpoint (AVM), hierarchy feature estimation (HFE), and virtual viewpoint evaluation (VVE) modules. The AVM module adaptively adjusts the angles of the virtual viewpoint and learns the ideal virtual viewpoint to generate informative multiple virtual views. The HFE module estimates hand keypoints through hierarchical feature extraction. The VVE module evaluates virtual viewpoints by using chained high-level functions from the HFE module. Transformer is used as a backbone to extract the long-range semantic joint relationships in hand depth images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the MPCTrans model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four challenging benchmark datasets.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1424-8220										Hubei Business Coll, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Inst Technol, Hubei Prov Key Lab Intelligent Robot, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China	Hubei Business Coll			2024-11-16	WOS:001351094600001	39517945

In specific, new demands are imposed on gears, including higher rotational speed, lower noise acceptance, and increased efficiency, as well as increased resistance against pitting and scuffing. To meet these demands, a better understanding of gear contacts is needed. The Eurostars project Effigears proposes a novel multi-perspective methodology for assessment of gear efficiency and contact analysis. The methodology consists of using a novel surface treatment method, Triboconditioning (R), implemented in a streamfinishing process, surface measurements using a scattered light method, experimental testing using the standardized FZG test rig, and contact simulations using a novel thermal elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication tool. It is found, in preliminary tests, that enhanced gear performance may be enhanced due to Triboconditioning (R) surface treat-ment. Findings also include better understanding of how surface characteristics and lubricants affect scuffing and pitting, and the effect of load distribution on gearset behavior.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2590-1230											Lund Univ, Dept Mech Engn Sci, Div Mech Mat & Component Design, Fac Engn LTH, Lund, SwedenTribonex AB, Uppsala, SwedenRoyal Inst Technol KTH, Dept Machine Design, Stockholm, SwedenOtec Prazisionsfinish GmbH, Straubenhardt, GermanyOptosurf GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany	Tribonex ABOtec Prazisionsfinish GmbHOptosurf GmbH			2024-02-03	WOS:001150299500001

However, this traditional linear concept of an SC is egotistic and oversimplified and does not sufficiently reflect the complex and cyclical structure of supplier-customer relationships in current economic and industrial situations. The interactional relationships and topological characteristics between suppliers and customers should be analyzed using supply networks (SNs) rather than traditional linear SCs. Therefore, this paper reconceptualizes SCs as SNs in complex adaptive systems (CAS), and presents three main contributions. First, we propose an integrated framework of CAS network by synthesizing multi-level network analysis from the network-, community-and vertex-perspective. The CAS perspective enables us to understand the advances of SN properties. Second, in order to emphasize the CAS properties of SNs, we conducted a real-world SN based on the Japanese industry and describe an advanced investigation of SN theory. The CAS properties help in enriching the SN theory, which can benefit SN management, community economics and industrial resilience. Third, we propose a quantitative metric of entropy to measure the complexity and robustness of SNs. The results not only support a specific understanding of the structural outcomes relevant to SNs, but also deliver efficient and effective support to the management and design of SNs.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				1099-4300										Nagoya Univ, Inst Innovat Future Soc, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, JapanTokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Soc, Tokyo 1080023, Japan				2017-09-13	WOS:000408739700007

The ability of a strategy supply chain to engender cultural competitiveness, or joint entrepreneurship and learning aimed at filling market gaps, is a key path through which a strategic supply chain may become a competitive advantage. A balance of trust and power within the supply chain offsets uncertainty and risks associated with the behaviors underlying cultural competitiveness. Using a multi-theoretic perspective, we discuss four strategies that firms use to balance a climate of trust and power in a strategic supply chain. Identifying an authority, generating a common supply chain identity, utilizing boundary spanning ties, and providing procedural and interactive justice are the strategies we discuss.

In the GBA multi-port system, Hong Kong, which is one of the world's largest shipping centres and once the leading port in the GBA, has experienced a continuous decline in recent years and has been successively overtaken by two other GBA ports (i.e. Shenzhen and Guangzhou). This paper explores the concentration, inequality, and competition of the GBA multi-port system during the 1972-2020 period from multi-faced perspectives. Results indicate that: 1) Hong Kong has witnessed an entire K-wave evolution, and 2) the evolution of the GBA multi-port system is a result of the asynchronous development stages of different GBA ports; 3) Missing the opportunity period of 2000-2008, the transfer of capital from Hong Kong and the Chinese "opening up" policy are the direct, the underlying and the root causes behind this evolution; 4) A tri-hub multi-port system has gradually taken shape in the GBA finally, in which Hong Kong is the second runner-up after Shenzhen and Guangzhou. The prospect of the Hong Kong Port would not be optimistic, and a negative impact of Guangzhou on Hong Kong could be expected in the near future. We recommend Hong Kong to carry out differentiation development with Shenzhen Port and Guangzhou Port and focus on international transhipment.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0964-5691	1873-524X										Ningbo Univ, Fac Maritime & Transportat, Ningbo 315832, Peoples R ChinaUniv Politecn Catalunya UPC Barcelona Tech, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Barcelona Innovat Transport BIT, Barcelona 08003, SpainNanyang Technol Univ, Sch Civil & Environm Engn, Singapore, SingaporeNingbo Univ, Donghai Acad, Ningbo 315211, Peoples R China				2023-03-30	WOS:000946834100001

First, in order to address the issue of imbalanced input and output information in depth map prediction tasks, as well as poor accuracy of predicted depth map boundaries, a depth map prediction model based on multiple perspectives and deep learning is built. Then, a single perspective modeling framework is proposed to address the scarcity of perspectives in practical situations, and a dynamic fusion model is built for single-view virtual reality scenes based on multi-view generation networks. The results indicated that the mean square error, average relative error, and average logarithmic error were minimized at 0.52, 0.138, and 0.068, respectively. The multi-threshold accuracy index demonstrated peak values at 0.772, 0.8821, and 0.947, respectively. The grid simplification algorithm exhibited the shortest running times at 1.57, 2.52, 3.91, and 6.53 s, respectively. Moreover, the single-view modeling frame displayed the smallest angle distance at 0.1449, while the overlap degree of the point cloud scene reached the highest levels at 77.47, 79.49, 83.5, and 84.47, respectively. To sum up, the model has a good application effect in virtual reality modeling and positively affects virtual reality technology development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1532-0626	1532-0634										Dongguan City Univ, Brand Ctr, Dongguan, Peoples R ChinaDongguan City Univ, Sch Marxism, Dongguan, Peoples R ChinaDongguan City Univ, Sch Language & Culture, Dongguan, Peoples R China	Dongguan City UnivDongguan City UnivDongguan City Univ			2024-01-24	WOS:001145218600001

The general non-homogeneous continuous-time Markov model (NHCTMM) and its analogous Markov reward model (NHCTMRM) are used to quantify the intensity of state transitions during the degradation process. Accordingly, the bound approximation approach is applied to solve the established NHCTMMs and NHCTMRMs, thus evaluating system performance including system availability and total maintenance cost to overcome their inherent computational difficulties. Furthermore, this study adopts a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize a proposed preventive maintenance model. A simulation illustrates the feasibility and practicability of the proposed approach.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0399-0559	1290-3868										Natl Def Univ, Chung Cheng Inst Technol, Dept Power Vehicle & Syst Engn, Daxi Township 33551, Tauyuan County, TaiwanROC Naval Acad, Dept Appl Sci, Kaohsiung 81345, Taiwan	Natl Def UnivROC Naval Acad			2015-05-28	WOS:000354294200007

Also, how to monitor the tracking failure in real-time and how to recover after tracking failure detected are very attractive research problems. In this paper, we propose the abrupt motion tracking method via the light regression memory network and multi-perspective object special proposals to resolve these problems. Firstly, we propose a highly accurate multi-perspective object special proposal method to recover tracking when tracking failure happened. Commonsense information is used as a priori knowledge to refine region proposals. Meanwhile, semantic target-aware estimation and spatial structure estimation are designed to rank and choose region proposals from two complementary viewpoints separately. By a comprehensive decision, the final proposals can fully cover the target's states even under abrupt motion. Secondly, we learn the memory network on a single-convolutional layer network by convolution linear regression. Without training on large offline datasets, it only need to fine-tune a fixed number of network parameters online by reliable target frame information to reinforce the memory of the changes in the target's appearance. Without size increasing and complex update strategy, the memory network can keep the good pattern of the target to reliably determine whether tracking fails, which ensures the effectivity of model updating and locating the target well. Finally, we integrate the memory network and region proposals into Siamese matching framework to achieve accurate abrupt motion tracking. Numerous experiments over multiple tracking benchmarks prove that the proposed tracker achieves excellent performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

On the downside, deriving alignments is challenging from the computational point of view, even more so when dealing with multiple perspectives in the process, such as, in particular, data. In fact, every observed trace must in principle be compared with infinitely many model traces. In this work, we tackle this computational bottleneck by borrowing the classical idea of encoding from machine learning. Instead of computing alignments directly and exactly, we do so in an approximate way after applying a lossy trace encoding that maps each trace into a corresponding compact, vectorial representation that retains only certain information of the original trace. We study trace encoding-based approximate alignments for processes equipped with event data attributes, from three different angles. First, we indeed show that computing approximate alignments in this way is much more efficient than in the exact setting. Second, we evaluate how accurate such approximate alignments are, considering different encoding strategies that focus on different features of the trace. Our findings suggest that sufficiently rich encodings actually yield good accuracy. Third, we consider the impact of frequency and density of model variants, comparing the effectiveness of using standard approximate multi-perspective alignments as opposed to a variant that incorporates probabilities. As a by-product of this analysis, we also obtain insights on how these two approaches perform in the presence of noise.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4379	1873-6076										Univ Lisbon, INESC ID Inst Super Tecn, Rua Alves Redol 9, P-1000019 Lisbon, PortugalFree Univ Bozen Bolzano, Piazza Domenicani 3, I-39100 Bolzano, BZ, Italy				2025-01-19	WOS:001394993700001

However, the literature lacks research linking the perspective of clients and organization in the context of courier service quality. The study aims to identify the factors determining courier service quality, their functions and interrelationships in business-to-customer (B2C) e-commerce. The main effect of research is the relational model, which is an original and complex approach to courier service quality considering the multi-stakeholder perspective of an online shop, a courier company and an e-customer. Apart from scientific contribution, the model can be used into managerial practice to formulate the recommendations for e-commerce and courier service sector. The research process involved using the quantitative method (electronic surveys conducted among e-shops and e-clients) and the qualitative method (in-depth-interviews carried out among courier enterprises). Finally, based on the empirical research results, the structural analysis was used to develop the model. As a result, the following groups of factors were distinguished that determine the quality of courier services: crucial, determinant, result, autonomous and external factors.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-6203											Bialystok Tech Univ, Fac Engn Management, Bialystok, Poland				2021-07-16	WOS:000664632300032	34019574

In this model, there is an oracle, called the Teacher, that can answer membership and equivalence queries posed by the Learner. Motivated by this feature, we first characterise the complexity of the equivalence problem for multiplicity tree automata, showing that it is logspace equivalent to polynomial identity testing.We then move to query complexity, deriving lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn multiplicity tree automata over both fixed and arbitrary fields. In the latter case, the bound is linear in the size of the target automaton. The best known upper bound on the query complexity over arbitrary fields derives from an algorithm of Habrard and Oncina (2006), in which the number of queries is proportional to the size of the target automaton and the size of a largest counterexample, represented as a tree, that is returned by the Teacher. However, a smallest counterexample tree may already be exponential in the size of the target automaton. Thus the above algorithm has query complexity exponentially larger than our lower bound, and does not run in time polynomial in the size of the target automaton.We give a new learning algorithm for multiplicity tree automata in which counterexamples to equivalence queries are represented as DAGs. The query complexity of this algorithm is quadratic in the target automaton size and linear in the size of a largest counterexample. In particular, if the Teacher always returns DAG counterexamples of minimal size then the query complexity is quadratic in the target automaton size-almost matching the lower bound, and improving the best previously-known algorithm by an exponential factor.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1532-4435											Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QD, England				2016-03-02	WOS:000369888000005

The model treats the full 3-D spatial transport and multiplication of neutrons, accounting also for the shape of the item and the spatial distribution of the source, in one-speed theory. For a given item and its source distribution, the model can predict the multiplicity rates more precisely than the point model, on which traditional neutron multiplicity counting is based. However, so far it has not been investigated how the enhanced accuracy of the calculated multiplicity rates (i.e. the solution of the direct task) can be used to estimate the parameters of interest of the measurement item, primarily the fission rate (the solution of the inverse task). Unlike for the point model, the multiplicity rates under the extended scheme can only be given numerically, as solutions of integral transport equations, and hence an analytical inversion of the formulae is not possible. In this work it is investigated how machine learning methods, primarily the use of artificial neural networks, which only need numerical values of the solution of the direct task (the multiplicity rates), can be used for this purpose. It is shown that for numerical test items containing a mixture of 239Pu and 240Pu, the fraction of the latter varying between 4% and 25%, one can extract the masses of both isotopes from a properly trained network.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0168-9002	1872-9576										Univ Tuzla, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & HercegChalmers Univ Technol, Div Subatom High Energy & Plasma Phys, SE-41296 Gothenburg, SwedenUniv Lancaster, Lancaster, England				2024-02-02	WOS:001143119700001

However, collecting real -world hyperspectral images (HSIs) with desired characteristics and diversity can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, leading to the data scarcity issue in HSI, and further limiting the potential of deep learningbased HSI applications. Existing work to tackle this issue fails to generate abundant, diverse, and reliable synthetic HSIs. This work proposes a multi -modal scene fusion -based method that diffusion from the abundance perspective for HSI synthesis, termed MSF-Diff. Concretely, highlights involve: (1) Synthesis in low -dimensional abundance space, other than original high -dimensional HSI space, greatly releases the difficulty; (2) Integration of multi -modal data greatly enriches the diversity of spatial distribution that the model can perceive; (3) Incorporation of the unmixing concept ensures that the generated synthetic HSI has reliable spectral profiles. The proposed research can generate a vast amount of HSI with a rich diversity in various categories and scenes, closely resembling realistic data. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the model produces reliable results and can be trusted for real -world applications.

We argue that this is because sustainable mobility products do not sufficiently satisfy consumer mobility motives. To in-vestigate this issue from a multi-modal perspective, we first synthesized previous research into a general measure of superordinate consumer motives in the mobility domain. We then conducted a representative survey experiment in which potential mobility consumers (N = 504) reported their mobility motives and their purchase intentions for a diverse set of mobility products in-cluding electric vehicles, hybrid-electric vehicles, efficient fuel cars, electric bikes, annual public transport tickets and sport utility vehicles. In line with our expectations, mobility motives sub-stantially contributed to explaining all purchase intentions on top of demographic variables and prior ownership. While environmental motives were the most important predictor, also status, financial, independence, safety and hedonic motives contributed substantially to the prediction of mobility purchase intentions. We discuss the importance of consumer motives as a basis for marketing and policy measures, to effectively promote sustainable mobility alternatives during the rise of multi-modal mobility.									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			0965-8564											Univ Geneva, Dept Psychol, Consumer Decis & Sustainable Behav Lab, Geneva, SwitzerlandUniv Geneva, Swiss Ctr Affect Sci, Geneva, SwitzerlandUniv Geneva, 40 Blvd Pont Arve, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland				2020-09-11	WOS:000564114200007

Design/methodology/approach This paper leverages insights from the literature in political science, policy, regulation, governance and IB; from the own earlier work; and from an inventory of CSR standards across a range of sectors and products. Findings This analysis' more nuanced approach to CSR standard multiplicity helps distinguish the different categories of standards; uncovers the existence of different types of standard multiplicity; and highlights complex trends in their evolution over time, discussing implications for the various firms targeted by, or involved in, these initiatives, and for CSR and GVC governance research. Research limitations/implications - This paper opens many avenues for future research on CSR multiplicity and its consequences; on lead firms governing GVCs from an IB perspective; and on institutional and market complexity. Practical implications - By providing overviews and classifications, this paper helps clarify CSR standards as "new regulators" and "instruments" for actors in business, society and government. Originality/value This paper contributes by filling gaps in different existing literatures concerning standard multiplicity. It also specifically adds a new perspective to the IB literature, which thus far has not fully incorporated the complexity and dynamics of CSR standard multiplicity in examining GVCs and MNE strategy and policy.									44	0	0	0	0	1	48			1525-383X	2054-1686										Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, NetherlandsUniv Amsterdam, Business Sch, Amsterdam, NetherlandsBabson Coll, Wellesley, MA USA				2019-11-20	WOS:000495139300005

Traditionally, it is assumed that the log provides a faithful and complete digital footprint of reality. However, assuming perfect logs is often unrealistic: real-life logs typically suffer from data quality issues, exposing uncertainty in their events, timestamps, and data attributes. We attack this problem by introducing a comprehensive framework for multi-perspective conformance checking dealing with uncertainty along three perspectives: control-flow, time, and data. From the modeling point of view, we consider process models formalized as Petri nets operating over data variables, and event logs presenting uncertainty at the event-and attribute-level. We cast conformance checking as an alignment problem, extending the traditional notions of alignment and cost function to deal with uncertainty along the three aforementioned perspectives. From the operational point of view, we show how (optimal) alignments can be computed through well established automated reasoning techniques from Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Specifically, we show how previous results on data-aware SMT-based conformance checking can be lifted to this more sophisticated setting, obtaining a flexible framework that can seamlessly handle different variants of the problem. We formally prove correctness of our approach and implement it in the conformance checker cocomot. Finally, we perform a thorough experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-life logs, demonstrating the overall promising performance of our framework.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0952-1976	1873-6769										Univ Bologna, Bologna, BO, ItalyFree Univ Bozen Bolzano, Bolzano, BZ, Italy				2023-10-10	WOS:001071451400001

Besides this, this paper also seeks to explore qualitative and theoretical perspectives to underscore the importance of AI and big data applications in multi-sectoral scenarios of businesses across the world. Moreover, this paper also aims at working out the scope of ontological communicative perspectives based on AI alongside emphasizing their relevance in business organizations that need to survive and sustain with a view to achieve their strategic goals. Design/methodology/approach This paper attempts to explore the qualitative perspectives to build a direction for strategic management via addressing the following research questions concerned with assessing the scope of ontological communicative perspectives in AI relevant to business organizations; exploring benefits of big data combined with AI in modern businesses; and underscoring the importance of AI and big data applications in multi-sectoral scenarios of businesses in today's world. Employing bibliometric analysis along with NVivo software to do sentiment analysis, this paper attempts to develop an understanding of what happens when AI and big data are combined in businesses. Findings AI and big data have tremendous bearing on modern businesses. Because big data comprises enormous information of diverse sorts, AI-assisted machines, tools and devices help modern businesses process it quickly, efficiently and meaningfully.

They efficiently represent the overlap between reads and hence, also the underlying genome sequence. However, sequencing errors and repeated subsequences render the identification of the true underlying sequence difficult. A key step in this process is the inference of the multiplicities of nodes and arcs in the graph. These multiplicities correspond to the number of times eachk-mer (resp.k+1-mer) implied by a node (resp. arc) is present in the genomic sequence. Determining multiplicities thus reveals the repeat structure and presence of sequencing errors. Multiplicities of nodes/arcs in the de Bruijn graph are reflected in their coverage, however, coverage variability and coverage biases render their determination ambiguous. Current methods to determine node/arc multiplicities base their decisions solely on the information in nodes and arcs individually, under-utilising the information present in the sequencing data.Results: To improve the accuracy with which node and arc multiplicities in a de Bruijn graph are inferred, we developed a conditional random field (CRF) model to efficiently combine the coverage information within each node/arc individually with the information of surrounding nodes and arcs. Multiplicities are thus collectively assigned in a more consistent manner.Conclusions: We demonstrate that the CRF model yields significant improvements in accuracy and a more robust expectation-maximisation parameter estimation. Truek-mers can be distinguished from erroneousk-mers with a higher F(1)score than existing methods.

For both parties the establishment of an accurate cost estimation (CE) framework supports managing suppliers' costs as well as manufacturer's quotation costing. Grounded on resource dependence theory and following a design science research approach, this study introduces a multi-perspective CE system inspired by statistical learning, deep learning, decision making, and multi-agent theory. We evaluate our system by a single case and computer simulation study, using empirical data coming from observations and archives at a large Bavarian original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The results indicate that our CE approach allows to select the most significant cost-drivers and predict total costs of parts and assemblies with high accuracy. This supports the supplier in efficiently managing its costs. In making the CE blackbox model transparent using a combination of model agnostic post-hoc explainable artificial intelligence approaches we foster user acceptance for both suppliers and OEMs. All CE artifacts are ensembled in a multi-agent system to automatically manage costs with suppliers and furthermore, as a model extension, can lead to a collaborative price agreement. Our system supports supply chain managers on both sides in entering into a sustainable long partnership.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0925-5273	1873-7579										Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Inst Factory Automat & Prod Syst, Egerlandstr 7-9, D-91058 Erlangen, GermanyFriedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Martensstr 5a, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany				2022-05-14	WOS:000790069500009

Despite recent advancements in deep learning enhancing DTA prediction, many single-model approaches do not adequately capture the multifaceted features of drugs and proteins, encompassing sequence, 3D structure, and interaction characteristics. Addressing this, we introduce MNNEL-DTA, a novel multi -perspective neural network ensemble learning approach for drug-target affinity prediction, which integrates multiple deep learning models, each emphasizing different feature perspectives. MNNEL-DTA not only extracts these diverse features but also quantifies the contribution of each, achieving test MSEs of 0.178 and 0.113 on the benchmark datasets Davis and KIBA, respectively. These results signify a relative improvement of 9.2% and 8.9% over the state-of-theart (SOTA) models. Moreover, we applied MNNEL-DTA to drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identified Glutethimide as an inhibitor for the target medin and Memantine as a joint agonist for S1R and SYK. Importantly, Memantine is already FDA-approved for AD. Meanwhile, Glutethimide, historically prescribed for insomnia, has demonstrated potential in preliminary studies for AD treatment, particularly targeting the medin protein. The success in identifying the dual drugs as potential therapeutic agents underscores the efficacy of our model in drug repurposing for AD.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0950-7051	1872-7409										Sun Yat Sen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 6, Dept Clin Lab, Guangzhou 510655, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, AI Sci Preferred Program AI4S, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaSun Yat Sen Univ, Artificial Intelligence Med Res Ctr, Sch Intelligent Syst Engn, Shenzhen Campus, Shenzhen 518107, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaChina Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung 40447, TaiwanAsia Univ, Dept Bioinformat & Med Engn, Taichung 41354, Taiwan				2024-02-28	WOS:001165374200001		
J	Hao, Suli; Shi, Fenfen										Research on Joint Extraction Method of Elevator Safety Risk Control Knowledge Based on Multi-Perspective Learning								IEEE ACCESS				12				159488	159502				10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3481266							Article	2024	2024	Knowledge graph visualizes the knowledge domain by describing various entities and concepts existing in the real world and the relationship between them, which is the key to intelligent recommendation and intelligent decision-making. However, the low accuracy of knowledge extraction has become a major bottleneck in the construction of high-quality knowledge graphs. The reason for this is because of the problem of highly overlapping triples and long-distance dependence between triples in each domain knowledge. Taking elevator safety risk control as the research object, this paper proposes a joint extraction algorithm with multi-perspective learning. Based on CasRel model, for the limitations of Casrel model, in the feature extraction stage, multi-head attention mechanism, bidirectional gated loop unit and convolutional neural network are introduced to extract the features output from BERT layer respectively. The purpose of extracting data features from multiple perspectives such as bidirectional perspective, local perspective and global perspective is realized. In this study, 5765 labeled elevator safety risk text data sets were divided into training sets and test sets according to the ratio of 4:1. The data set is used to verify the CasRel model before and after the improvement. The experimental results show that the values of P (accuracy rate), R (recall rate) and F1 of the improved CASREL model are 82.06%, 79.53% and 80.78%, respectively, which are 6.60%, 9.32% and 8.03% higher than those of the traditional CASREL model. This proves the validity of the improved CasRel model (BERT-BiGRU-MHA-CNN-CasRel). At the same time, it shows that the improved CasRel model can better complete the triplet extraction task, and can better complete the triplet extraction work. In addition, it is also confirmed that this method can extract elevator safety risk prevention and control knowledge more accurately, which provides data support for intelligent decision-making of elevator safety risk prevention and control based on knowledge graph, and also provides method support for knowledge extraction in other fields.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2169-3536											China Univ Min & Technol Beijing, Sch Management, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaHebei Univ Econ & Business, Sch Management Sci & Informat Engn, Shijiazhuang 050061, Hebei, Peoples R China				2024-11-15	WOS:001349747200001

While many recent works have taken essential steps on GAN-generated faces, more threatening attacks related to identity swapping or diffusion models are still overlooked. And the forgery traces hidden in unknown attacks from the open-world unlabeled faces remain under-explored. To push the related frontier research, we introduce a novel task named Open-World DeepFake Attribution, and the corresponding benchmark OW-DFA++, which aims to evaluate attribution performance against various types of fake faces in open-world scenarios. Meanwhile, we propose a Multi-Perspective Sensory Learning (MPSL) framework that aims to address the challenge of OW-DFA++. Since different forged faces have different tampering regions and frequency artifacts, we introduce the Multi-Perception Voting (MPV) module, which aligns inter-sample features based on global, multi-scale local, and frequency relations. The MPV module effectively filters and groups together samples belonging to the same attack type. Pseudo-labeling is another common and effective strategy in semi-supervised learning tasks, and we propose the Confidence-Adaptive Pseudo-labeling (CAP) module, using soft pseudo-labeling to enhance the class compactness and mitigate pseudo-noise induced by similar novel attack methods. The CAP module imposes strong constraints and adaptively filters samples with high uncertainty to improve the accuracy of the pseudo-labeling. In addition, we extend the MPSL framework with a multi-stage paradigm that leverages pre-train technique and iterative learning to further enhance traceability performance. Extensive experiments and visualizations verify the superiority of our proposed method on the OW-DFA++ and demonstrate the interpretability of the deepfake attribution task and its impact on improving the security of the deepfake detection area.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0920-5691	1573-1405										Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaTencent, Youtu Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China				2024-08-17	WOS:001289396600002

To solve this problem, most previous methods align point sets by either partially exploring available information or blindly utilizing unnecessary information, which may lead to undesired results or extra computation complexity. Accordingly, we propose a novel solution for the multi-view registration under the perspective of Expectation-Maximization (EM). The proposed method assumes that each data point is generated from one unique Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), where its corresponding points in other point sets are regarded as Gaussian centroids with equal covariance and membership probabilities. As it is difficult to obtain real corresponding points in the registration problem, they are approximated by the nearest neighbor in each other aligned point sets. Based on this assumption, it is reasonable to define the likelihood function including all rigid transformations, which require to be estimated for multi-view registration. Subsequently, the EM algorithm is derived to estimate rigid transformations with one Gaussian covariance by maximizing the likelihood function. Since the GMM component number is automatically determined by the number of point sets, there is no trade-off between registration accuracy and efficiency in the proposed method. Finally, the proposed method is tested on several benchmark data sets and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance on the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness for multi-view registration.									20	4	0	0	0	0	25			1057-7149	1941-0042										Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Software Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R ChinaZhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430073, Peoples R China				2020-10-13	WOS:000574739100004	32956059

Pinterest and Huaban are two typical CCSNs. Recently, there is active research on CCSNs. As a kind of content based social network, CCSNs involve not only the explicit social relations from user "following", but also content-based social relations from re-pin paths and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel user representation learning algorithm, Multi perspective User2Vec Representation (MUVR). It combines the two types of social relations to get the rich user sequences. Then the representation learning is implemented by using the skip-gram algorithm. Experimental results on Huaban.com demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can represent network well. It presents more competitive results in the followee recommendation, re-pinner recommendation and multi-label classification.

Stochastic mixed integer linear programming determines order allocations, line investments, and personnel plans. The potential to swiftly adapt plans while obeying local constraints is demonstrated with a large automotive supplier.

Although a number of prior studies have been conducted to address complex issues that arise from construction projects, few studies have summarised the applications and discussed the capacity of MASs from the perspective of construction management. To fill the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive literature review of MAS applications from the perspective of construction management. Design/methodology/approach Web of Science and Scopus are the most commonly used international databases in conducting the literature reviews. A total of 86 relevant papers published in SCI-Expanded, SSCI and Ei Compendex journals related to the application of MASs from the perspective of construction management are selected to be analysed and discussed in this paper. Findings Based on the 86 collected publications, the utilisations of MASs to support the management of the supply chain and the improvement of project performance are identified from the perspective of construction management, the characteristics and barriers of current MAS applications are analysed, a framework for developing agent-based models to address complex problems is proposed, and future research directions of MAS applications are discussed. Originality/value This review can serve as a useful reference for scholars to enhance their understanding of the current research and guide future research on MASs.

The presence of anomalies not only has an enormous impact on the economic well-being of the business, but also interferes with our ability to mine useful information from event logs. In this article, we propose GRASPED, a GRU-AE Network based multi-perSpective business ProcEss anomaly Detection model. GRASPED can detect anomalies not only from the control flow but also from the data perspective of a business process. GRASPED is based on an autoencoder (AE) with gated recurrent units (GRU) which is trained in an unsupervised fashion (i.e., does not require any labeling of the data). In addition, GRASPED introduces the teacher forcing method as well as the attention mechanism to improve its detection performance. GRASPED does not require training on a clean log (i.e., it can be trained and perform anomaly detection directly on logs containing anomalies). We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic logs as well as real-life logs. The experiment results show that GRASPED outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for both trace-level and attribute-level anomaly detection.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1939-1374											Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China				2023-11-11	WOS:001085223500025

EMR includes the health-related information of patients and forms the main factor of e-health applications. Moreover, EMR contains the legal records that are created in the medical centre and ambulatory environments. These records serve as the data source for electronic health record. Although hospitals utilise the EMR system, healthcare professionals experience difficultly in trusting this system. Studies devoted to EMR acceptance in hospitals are lacking, particularly those on the EMR system in the contexts of privacy and security concerns based on multi-criteria perspective. Thus, the current study proposes a decision support examination framework on how individual, security and privacy determinants influence the acceptance and use of EMR. The proposed framework is based on a multi-criteria perspective derived from healthcare professionals in Malaysia as frame of reference. The framework comprises four phases. The sub-factors of individual, security and privacy determinants were investigated in the two initial phases. Thereafter, the sub-factors were identified with uniform multi-criteria perspective to establish a decision matrix. The decision matrix used individual uniform as basis to cluster the sub-factors and user perspectives. Subsequently, a new 'multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach' was adopted. Integrated technique for order of preference by similarity (TOPSIS) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) were used as bases in employing the MCDM approach to rank each group of factors. K-means clustering was also applied to identify the critical factors in each group. Healthcare professionals in Malaysia were selected as respondents and 100 questionnaires were distributed to those employed in 5 Malaysian public hospitals. A conceptual model adapted from Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) was employed to clarify the connection between individual, privacy and security determinants and EMR system acceptance and use in the selected context. After collecting the data sets (363), structural equation modelling was used to analyse data related to EMR acceptance and use. Results are as follows. (1) Five determinants (i.e. data integrity, confidentiality, non-repudiation, facilitating conditions and effort expectancy) exerted an explicit and important positive effect on EMR acceptance and use. (2) Three determinants (i.e. unauthorised, error and secondary use) exerted a direct and significant negative effect on EMR acceptance and use. (3) Three other determinants (i.e. authentication, performance expectancy and habit) insignificantly affected the behavioural intention of healthcare experts in Malaysia to use EMR.									70	0	0	0	4	0	72			2190-7188	2190-7196										Meddle East Univ MEU, Fac Business, Amman, JordanUniv Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Dept Comp, Tanjong Malim, Perak, MalaysiaUniv Sains Islam Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Nilai, Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia	Meddle East Univ MEU			2020-05-28	WOS:000533028700021

Furthermore, project complexity adds to the challenges faced by the project management team. Moreover, projects are performed by project management teams comprising various individuals from different backgrounds. While they perform their project tasks, they have to face dynamics in the projects that lead to major challenges or stress and bounce back from negative experiences to be less likely to experience the detrimental effects of intimidating, uncertain situations. This study aims to show the influence of multi-perspective factors on team resilience and to confirm how team resilience influences team performance. A descriptive, quantitative study was conducted to test the six hypotheses of the study. Data collected through purposive sampling and snowball techniques were analyzed using a structural equation model with SmartPLS software version 3.2.9. The finding shows that individual resilience from the individual perspective, team resources, team interactions from the team perspective and organizational practice all have a positive and significant influence on team resilience, but transformational leadership does not. Team resilience has a positive, significant relationship with team performance. Team resilience appears to have had a strong and significant effect on team performance in multiple industries in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research implications and suggestions for future research are also given.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2071-1050										Bina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch Doctor Res Management, Jakarta 11480, IndonesiaBina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch Undergrad Program, Business Management Program, Jakarta 11480, IndonesiaBina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch Undergrad Program, Management Program, Jakarta 11480, IndonesiaBina Nusantara Univ, BINUS Business Sch Undergrad Program, Entrepreneurship Program, Bandung 40181, IndonesiaRMIT Univ, Sch Property Construct & Project Management, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia				2022-11-11	WOS:000877232700001

In our preliminary work, we have proposed the use of Time Perspective (TP), which takes into consideration how people think of or appraise their past, present, or future life would shape their behavior, in suicide tendency detection based on suicide notes. The detection result is highly dependent upon a ternary classification task that groups any suicide tendency into one of the three pre-defined types. In this work, we define the suicidal emotion trajectory, a concept that is based on TP and used for depicting the dynamic evolution of an individual's emotional state over time, and this trajectory serve as an auxiliary task to the primary ternary classification task for a multi-task learning model, i.e. TP-MultiBert. The model features Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) components, replacing its counterpart, i.e., GloVe, in the previous model. Thanks to its desirable capability of understanding word contextual relationships, as well as multi-task learning capability of leveraging complementary information from various tasks, BERT shows promissing results in further improving the performance of suicide ideation detection.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2653-6226										Commun Univ China, Sch Comp & Cyber Sci, Beijing 100024, Peoples R ChinaZhongxing Telecommun Equipment Corp, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China	Zhongxing Telecommun Equipment Corp			2025-06-22	WOS:001510701400007

In order to enable the reader to understand the development of this field rapidly and fully, this paper provides a comprehensive review. First, the development history of multi-robot collaborative SLAM is reviewed. Second, the fusion algorithms and architectures are detailed. Third, from the perspective of machine learning classification, the existing algorithms in this field are discussed, including the latest updates. All of this will make it easier for readers to discover problems that need to be studied further.

The structural and statistical properties of different regions of degraded underwater images are damaged at different levels, resulting in a global nonuniform drift of the feature representation, causing further degradation of visual performance. To handle these issues, we present an underwater image enhancement method via multi-interval subhistogram perspective equalization to address the issues posed by underwater images. We estimate the degree of feature drifts in each area of an image by extracting the statistical characteristics of the image, using this information to guide feature enhancement to achieve adaptive feature enhancement, thereby improving the visual effect of degraded images. We first design a variational model that uses the difference between data items and regular items to improve the color correction performance of the method based on subinterval linear transformation. In addition, a multithreshold selection method, which adaptively selects a threshold array for interval division, is developed. Ultimately, a multi-interval subhistogram equalization method, which performs histogram equalization in each subhistogram to improve the image contrast, is presented. Experiments on underwater images with various scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms many state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.									145	5	0	0	12	0	151			0364-9059	1558-1691										Dalian Maritime Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China				2023-11-10	WOS:000932807500001

The optimization model may also have built-in redundancy that cannot always be directly derived from the multiplicity of the superstructure.A basic GDP representation (BGR) involving logical relations is defined, and can be constructed by applying a standard natural representation of the process. Basic MINLP representation (BMR) is defined by transforming the logical relations to algebraic ones.MINLP representation (MR) is defined through a fixed form of BMR. Equivalency and representativeness of MR-s in general form can be analyzed by reducing them to their BMRs. BMR can be automatically generated, and can serve as a reference representation.Binary and continuous multiplicity of MR are defined. If the supergraph, i.e. the graph representing the superstructure, is structurally redundant (i.e. there are isomorphic graphs amongst their subgraphs) then BMR has binary multiplicity. Conversely, the structural redundancy of the graph does not follow from the binary multiplicity of its BMR.Different kinds of multiplicity and redundancy measures of the MINLP representation will be defined in Part 11 of this series in order to help inventing tools for decreasing their detrimental effect. Alternative MINLP representations will there be defined, constructed, and compared from the viewpoint of ideality, minimality, and solution properties. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

With the development of data science and computer technology, uncertain decision-making with multi-modal, nonlinear, unbalanced, and incomplete characteristics has become a trend, posing a great challenge to traditional uncertain decision-making methods. In view of this, this paper proposes a dynamic decision-making paradigm for multi-modal information by fusing composite rough set and machine learning under the perspective of human-computer interaction. First, a multi-modal hybrid attribute information system (MHAIS) is constructed for incomplete multi-modal hybrid attribute information in numerical, textual and image modals, and several degradation scenarios of MHAIS are discussed. Second, to achieve multi-modal information fusion and reduce redundant attributes, multi-modal hybrid binary relationships are constructed for numerical, textual and image modals in MHAIS, and multi-modal composite rough set and its attribute reduction method is given. Then, uncertainty decision-making models conforming to different realistic decision-making situations are established from the perspectives of three multi-modal information fusion strategies, namely feature-level fusion, model-level fusion and decision-level fusion, respectively. Finally, the above process is extended to the dynamic decision-making process, and the corresponding incremental learning paradigm is given. An example study using real datasets of rheumatoid arthritis patients from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and 10 public datasets is carried out in this paper to verify the scientific and superiority of the proposed method. On the one hand, this paper introduces the idea of human-computer interaction and different strategies of multi-modal information fusion into realistic uncertain decision-making problems, and on the other hand, it makes a new contribution of the integration of rough set theory and machine learning in the development of management science, decision science and computer science.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-2535	1872-6305										Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian 710126, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept TCM Big Data Res, State Key Lab Tradit Chinese Med Syndrome, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China				2025-07-02	WOS:001517003400001

Such problems are prototypical in robust control and stability analysis. Under nondegeneracy conditions, we show that the multiplicities of the active eigenvalues at a critical matrix remain unchanged under small perturbations of the problem. Furthermore, each distinct active eigenvalue corresponds to a single Jordan block. This behavior is crucial for optimality conditions and numerical methods.

Among the driving forces behind network economy, the commercialization of 5G, the fifth generation of mobile technologies, is especially noteworthy. How does 5G induce such a transition? How do countries respond? are questions deserving more investigation. However, most discussions of 5G have been confined to standardization or standard-setting. To take into accounts interactions between technology and economy, we adopt Geels' (2002) multi-level perspective to put 5G transition in the social-technical context. We choose China as an influential case and deploy mixed methods to analyze a variety of data sources. The results show a rich picture of technological transition, including: 1) 5G standard-setting as a transition trigger in the global level; 2) IoT incubation in the niche level; and 3) regime configuration in the national level. We help transcend the limitation of standardization studies, extend the scope of transition studies into network economy, and introduce more industrial dynamics.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			0040-1625	1873-5509										Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Technol Management, Room 545,101,Sec 2,Kuangfu Rd, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan				2022-08-13	WOS:000833546000017

Efficient methods for crossing imaginary roots identification exist. However, to the best of the author's knowledge, the multiplicity of such roots was not deeply investigated. In recent papers by the authors [1], [2], it is emphasized that the multiplicity of the zero spectral value can exceed the number of the coupled scalar delay-differential equations and a constructive approach Vandermonde-based allowing to an adaptive bound for such a multiplicity is provided. Namely, it is shown that the zero spectral value multiplicity depends on the system structure (number of delays and number of non zero coefficients of the associated quasipolynomial) rather than the degree of the associated quasipolynomial [3]. This technical note extends the constructive approach in investigating the multiplicity of crossing imaginary roots j omega where omega not equal 0 and establishes a link with a new class of functional confluent Vandermonde matrices. A symbolic algorithm for computing the LU-factorization for such matrices is provided. As a byproduct of the proposed approach, a bound sharper than the Polya-Szego generic bound arising from the principle argument is established.									43	1	0	0	0	0	44			0018-9286	1558-2523										Univ Paris 11, CNRS, Supelec, IPSA, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, FranceUniv Paris 11, CNRS, Supelec, Lab Signaux & Syst, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France				2016-07-20	WOS:000378426000015

Variable temperatures on the integrated utility associated with empathy provide agents with several different modes, including collectivity, equality, oligopoly, and monopoly. Therefore, we can change the agents mode artificially according to the task requirement and examine agents evolution from the perspective of continuous changes on temperature. Then we present a bandit algorithm called Empathy-based Interactive Learner (EIL), by which agents can enable affective utility evaluation and adaptive learning procedure in multi-agent systems. We test EILs performance in four games, including the iterated prisoners dilemma, the ultimatum game and its multi-player variant, and the survival game. The results showed that EIL could significantly improve cooperation, promote altruism behaviors, and stimulate the sense of fairness in the equal mode, whereas increasing the trend of self-interest gradually in the process of switching to other modes. To sum up, our model illustrates that empathy can act as a virtual drive underlying cooperation and competition. This provides novel methods and insights in regulating behaviors in multi-agent systems, as well as artificial subjects in psychology and behavioral economics experiments.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2169-3536											Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China				2020-11-17	WOS:000583548900001		
J	Gashi, Milot; Mutlu, Belgin; Thalmann, Stefan					Thalmann, Stefan/0000-0001-6529-7958					Impact of Interdependencies: Multi-Component System Perspective toward Predictive Maintenance Based on Machine Learning and XAI								APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL				13	5					3088			10.3390/app13053088							Article	MAR 2023	2023	Taking the multi-component perspective in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is one promising approach to improve prediction quality. Therefore, detection and modeling of interdependencies within systems are important, especially as systems become more complex and personalized. However, existing solutions in PdM mostly focus on a single-component perspective, neglecting the dependencies between components, even if interdependencies can be found between most components in the real world. The major reason for this lost opportunity is the challenge of identifying and modeling interdependencies between components. This paper introduces a framework to identify interdependencies and explain their impact on PdM within a Multi-Component System (MCS). The contribution of this approach is two-fold. First, it shows the impact of modeling interdependencies in predictive analytics. Second, it helps to understand which components interact with each other and to which degree they affect the deterioration state of corresponding components. As a result, our approach can identify and explain the existence of interdependencies within components. In particular, we demonstrate that time from last change of component is a valuable feature to quantify interdependencies. Moreover, we show that taking into account the interdependencies provides a statistically significant improvement of f1-score by 7% on average compared to the model where interdependencies are neglected. We expect that our findings will improve maintenance scheduling in the industry while improving prediction models in general.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2076-3417										Pro2future GmbH Graz, A-8010 Graz, AustriaKarl Franzens Univ Graz, Business Analyt & Data Sci Ctr, A-8010 Graz, Austria	Pro2future GmbH Graz			2023-03-27	WOS:000947033200001

However, it is difficult to learn robust feature representations due to the potential noise in pseudo-labels caused by inefficient consistency learning, and poor class diversity in feature spaces. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method using Collaborative intra-inter Contrastive Learning and Multi-Perspective Consistency (CCL-MPC). First, we propose a collaborative intra-inter contrastive learning strategy that includes symmetric bidirectional contrastive learning and certainty-guided contrastive learning, to exploit the intrinsic differences between inter-image and intra-image feature representations. Second, we design a multi-perspective consistency learning strategy to improve the class diversity by utilizing a dual-branch network and two augmented views. Additionally, we dynamically partition the pseudo-label certainty area for auxiliary consistency learning to reduce the potential noise during the training process. Experimental results on the publicly available datasets demonstrate that CCL-MPC can achieve better segmentation performance than the state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks.

Both of these families of codes are based on polynomials over finite fields, and both have been the source of recent advances in coding theory: folded RS codes were the first known explicit construction of capacity-achieving list decodable codes [V. Guruswami and A. Rudra, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 54 (2008), pp. 135-150], and multiplicity codes were the first construction of high-rate locally decodable codes [S. Kopparty, S. Saraf, and S. Yekhanin, J. ACM, 61 (2014), 28]. In this work, we show that folded RS codes and multiplicity codes are in fact better than previously known in the context of list decoding and local list decoding. Our first main result shows that folded RS codes achieve list decoding capacity with constant list sizes, independent of the block length. Prior work with constant list sizes first obtained list sizes that are polynomial in the block length and relied on pre-encoding with subspace evasive sets to reduce the list sizes to a constant [V. Guruswami and C. Wang, IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 59 (2013), pp. 3257-3268], [Z. Dvir and S. Lovett, Proc. 44th STOC, ACM, 2012, 351-358]. The list size we obtain is (1/epsilon)(O)((1/epsilon)) where epsilon is the gap to capacity, which matches the list size obtained by pre-encoding with subspace evasive sets. For our second main result, we observe that univariate multiplicity codes exhibit similar behavior, and we use this, together with additional ideas, to show that multivariate multiplicity codes are locally list decodable up to their minimum distance. By known reductions, this gives, in turn, capacity-achieving locally list decodable codes with query complexity exp((& otilde;)((log N)(5)/(6))). This improves on the tensor-based construction of [B. Hemenway, N. Ron-Zewi, and M. Wootters, SIAM J. Comput., 49 (2019), pp. 157-195], which gave capacity-achieving locally list decodable codes of query complexity N-& Otilde;(1/log log N), and is close to the best known query complexity of exp(& Otilde;(root log N)) for high-rate locally (uniquely) decodable codes .									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0097-5397	1095-7111										Rutgers State Univ, Dept Math, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USARutgers State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USAUniv Haifa, Dept Comp Sci, IL-31905 Haifa, IsraelStanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USAStanford Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA				2023-10-28	WOS:001082560700002

The multiplicity analysis is performed through bifurcation diagrams for two feed case scenarios. The main variables that affect the steady state behavior are the reflux ratio, the hydrocarbon feed flowrate, the reboiler heat duty, and the catalyst load (liquid holdup). For the first case only a single steady state was found, while in the second case input and output multiplicities were determined. It is shown that the introduction in the feed of the recalcitrant 4,6-DMDBT, plays a crucial role in the RDC design and operation. A set of values of the bifurcation parameters for an appropriate operation of the RDC are recommended to avoid the multiplicity region and to reach the required output targets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Many MTS manifest inherent periodic fluctuations, which are highly significant for effective modeling. However, existing methods for modeling periodic features mainly focus on multi-period temporal features of univariate series and have not sufficiently addressed complex interdependencies in multiple periods, including dynamic dependencies among variables within the same period (Intra-period) and across different periods (Inter-period). Furthermore, methods for modeling dynamic interdependencies are insufficient for mining the inherent multi-periodicity of MTS. Thus, collaboratively capturing both intra-period and inter-period interdependencies remains challenging. To address above challenges, this paper introduces the Periodic Dynamics Forecasting Network (PDFNet) for modeling multi-period dynamic interdependencies of MTS. We design a periodic feature extraction module that utilizes frequency domain analysis to identify the multi-period features of MTS. The multi-period temporal networks module is designed to capture temporal features within and across periods from a multi-period perspective. To capture intra-period and inter-period dynamic dependencies among multiple variables, we propose a gated periodic recurrent unit and a gated graph structure learning module to construct dynamic graphs and then effectively learn intra-period and inter-period information through dynamic graph convolution networks. Extensive experiments on multiple MTS datasets have demonstrated our superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-3203	1873-5142										Chongqing Univ, Sch Big Data & Software Engn, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ, Ningbo Innovat Ctr, Ningbo 315100, Peoples R China				2025-05-24	WOS:001491605200001

Sustainability standards (SS) are essential tools for transnational trade governance because they increase the possibility of recognizing products from sustainable sources. However, there is currently a proliferation of SS in almost every industry. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to establish how standard interactions such as competition, cooperation, and overlap shape the impact of multiplicity on trade costs. We apply the framework to the palm oil industry by using the information on three aspects of SS schemes: the requirements, the institutional design, and the cooperation strategies. Our results indicate that the North-South multiplicity in the palm oil market is characterized by high overlap, but there exists a balanced co-opetition in the standard market. As the cooperation strategies between the SS schemes are very shallow, there might be potential trade costs associated with the SS multiplicity in the palm oil industry.

Owing to differences in their individual roles and responsibilities, different stakeholders prefer different approaches to architect and decompose a system to optimize their attributes of interest. However, owing to increasing complexity of modern engineering systems, optimizing multiple attributes of complex systems has become challenging; moreover, very few researches have been published in this regard. Thus, to address this gap in available literature, this paper presents a multi-attribute optimization framework for complex system decomposition. The proposed framework primarily optimizes two attributes-system robustness (to the perspective of the stakeholder), and modularity-while system maintainability is considered an optimization constraint. Feasibility of the proposed framework has been demonstrated through a case study, wherein system attributes of three different mechanical clock models having different architectures were optimized.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0934-9839	1435-6066										Seoul Natl Univ, Inst Engn Res, Grad Sch Engn Practice, 1 Gwanak Ro, Seoul 08826, South KoreaMIT, Sociotech Syst Res Ctr, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAKorea Adv Inst Sci & Technol KAIST, Dept Aerosp Engn, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea				2020-07-29	WOS:000548758500001

Accurate perception requires that this uncertainty be correctly represented, manipulated, and learned about. The choices subjects make in various psychophysical experiments suggest that they do indeed take such uncertainty into account when making perceptual inferences, posing the question as to how uncertainty is represented in the activities of neuronal populations. Most theoretical investigations of population coding have ignored this issue altogether, the few existing proposals that address it do so in such a way that it is fatally conflated with another facet of perceptual problems that also needs correct handling: multiplicity (that is, the simultaneous presence of multiple distinct stimuli). We present and validate a more powerful proposal for the way that population activity may encode uncertainty, both distinctly from and simultaneously with multiplicity.									60	0	0	0	38	0	72			0899-7667	1530-888X										UCL, Gatsby Computat Neurosci Unit, London WC1N 3AR, England				2003-10-01	WOS:000184871800001	14511521

We evaluated the viability of IntersectionExplorer in the context of conference paper recommendation, through three user studies performed in different settings to understand the usefulness of the tool for diverse audiences and scenarios. We analyzed several dimensions of user experience and other, more objective, measures of performance. Results indicate that users found IntersectionExplorer to be a relatively fast and effortless tool to navigate through conference papers. Objective measures of performance linked to interaction showed that users were not only interested in exploring combinations of machine-produced recommendations with bookmarks of users and tags, but also that this "augmentation" actually resulted in increased likelihood of finding relevant papers in explorations. Overall, the findings suggest the viability of IntersectionExplorer as an effective tool, and indicate that its multi-perspective approach to exploring recommendations has great promise as a way of addressing the complex human-recommender system interaction problem.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			1071-5819	1095-9300										Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Comp Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200A, B-3001 Leuven, BelgiumPontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Dept Ciencia Computac, Vicuna Mackenna 4860, Santiago 7820436, ChileUniv Pittsburgh, Sch Comp & Informat, 135 North Bellefield Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USAUniv Ghent, IMEC IDLab, Technol Park 19, B-9052 Zwijnaarde, Belgium				2019-01-04	WOS:000453495900006

Based on the framework of smart manufacturing system (SMS) proposed by China, a reference smart manufacturing integration system (SMIS) from multi-level and multi-perspective was proposed. The reference model of SMIS was analyzed by means of system engineering. Based on this model, the overall architecture of SMIS was proposed. Then, the physics subsystem, information integration subsystem, network integration subsystem, data integration subsystem, and visualization integration subsystem for SMIS were proposed through the overall architecture of SMIS. Finally, the above integrated subsystems were collected together to deduce the implementation path of SMIS. Four reference subsystems for SMIS proposed in this paper have achieved good effects in the projects we participated in, which were organized by the state. The research results of this paper can be used as a reference for industry and government to design, set, and carry out SMIS. At the same time, it has a certain reference value for the improvement and supplement of national smart manufacturing system architecture.									30	1	0	0	0	0	32			0268-3768	1433-3015										Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Key Lab Adv Mfg Environm, Shanghai Res Ctr Ind Informat,Sch Mech Engn, Producer Serv Dev Innovat Ctr,Inst Smart Mfg, 800 Dongchuan Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China				2019-08-02	WOS:000475921300051

Hate speech is topically focused (misogyny, sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.), and each specific manifestation of hate speech targets different vulnerable groups based on characteristics such as gender (misogyny, sexism), ethnicity, race, religion (xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia), sexual orientation (homophobia), and so on. Most automatic hate speech detection approaches cast the problem into a binary classification task without addressing either the topical focus or the target-oriented nature of hate speech. In this paper, we propose to tackle, for the first time, hate speech detection from a multi-target perspective. We leverage manually annotated datasets, to investigate the problem of transferring knowledge from different datasets with different topical focuses and targets. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we explore the ability of hate speech detection models to capture common properties from topic-generic datasets and transfer this knowledge to recognize specific manifestations of hate speech; (2) we experiment with the development of models to detect both topics (racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny) and hate speech targets, going beyond standard binary classification, to investigate how to detect hate speech at a finer level of granularity and how to transfer knowledge across different topics and targets; and (3) we study the impact of affective knowledge encoded in sentic computing resources (SenticNet, EmoSenticNet) and in semantically structured hate lexicons (HurtLex) in determining specific manifestations of hate speech. We experimented with different neural models including multitask approaches. Our study shows that: (1) training a model on a combination of several (training sets from several) topic-specific datasets is more effective than training a model on a topic-generic dataset; (2) the multi-task approach outperforms a single-task model when detecting both the hatefulness of a tweet and its topical focus in the context of a multi-label classification approach; and (3) the models incorporating EmoSenticNet emotions, the first level emotions of SenticNet, a blend of SenticNet and EmoSenticNet emotions or affective features based on Hurtlex, obtained the best results. Our results demonstrate that multi-target hate speech detection from existing datasets is feasible, which is a first step towards hate speech detection for a specific topic/target when dedicated annotated data are missing.

The core of our approach is the formulation of the residual covariances as a combination of geometric and photometric noise sources. And our key novel contribution is the derivation of a term modelling how local 2D patches suffer from perspective deformation when imaging 3D surfaces around a point. Together, these add up to an efficient and general formulation which not only improves the accuracy of both feature-based and direct methods, but can also be used to estimate more accurate measures of the state entropy and hence better founded point visibility thresholds. We validate our model with synthetic and real data and integrate it into photometric and feature-based Bundle Adjustment, improving their accuracy with a negligible overhead.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2377-3766											Univ Zaragoza, Sch Engn, Zaragoza 50009, SpainGerman Aerosp Ctr DLR, Inst Robot & Mechatron, Percept & Cognit Dept, D-82234 Wessling, GermanyTech Univ Munich, Dept Aerosp & Geodesy, D-80333 Munich, Germany				2022-02-19	WOS:000748560800005

A numerical-symbolic algorithm for computing the multiplicity of a component of an algebraic set								JOURNAL OF COMPLEXITY				22	4			475	489				10.1016/j.jco.2006.04.003							Article	AUG 2006	2006	Let F-1, F-2,..., F-t be multivariate polynomials (with complex coefficients) in the variables z(1), z(2),..., z(n). The common zero locus of these polynomials, V (F-1, F-2,..., F-t) = {p is an element of C-n vertical bar F-i (p) = 0 for 1 <= i <= t}, determines an algebraic set. This algebraic set decomposes into a union of simpler, irreducible components. The set of polynomials imposes on each component a positive integer known as the multiplicity of the component. Multiplicity plays an important role in many practical applications. It determines roughly "how many times the component should be counted in a computation". Unfortunately, many numerical methods have difficulty in problems where the multiplicity of a component is greater than one. The main goal of this paper is to present an algorithm for determining the multiplicity of a component of an algebraic set. The method sidesteps the numerical stability issues which have obstructed other approaches by incorporating a combined numerical-symbolic technique. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

RRACs have focused on increasing government revenues through fiscal policies and purchasing goods and services locally through local content policies. An evolving literature suggests that these policy interventions have delivered mixed outcomes. This paper sets out to capture and understand stakeholder perspectives with respect to three research questions: (1) what are the main problems preventing RRACs from building linkages between the mining and other economic sectors? (2) what are the key conditions for leveraging mining linkages for broad-based economic transformation? and (3) can these conditions be created and, if so, how? A Q -meth-odology analysis involving 46 statements and 66 participants was undertaken, which revealed three shared perspectives that stress the need for redefined context-specific industrial policies and the development infrastructure, knowledge-based assets, and supplier capacities to enable inter-sectoral linkages that promote economic transformation. The research offers insights on the key areas of consensus and dissensus amongst multi-stakeholder groups with respect to the state of, the barriers to, and the conditions for transformative linkage building in RRACs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2214-790X	2214-7918										Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst SMI, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaAssociated Inst Univ Basel, Swisspeace, Basel, SwitzerlandAfr World Bank, Off Chief Economist, Washington, DC USAUniv Queensland, Inst Social Sci Res, Brisbane, Qld 4072, AustraliaLevel 4,Sir James Foots Bldg 47A,SMI, St Lucia, Australia	Associated Inst Univ BaselAfr World Bank			2023-01-12	WOS:000899186300003

The framework enables identifying the role of CI elements and quantifying the consequences of scenarios of multiple failures, with respect to the different perspectives considered. To present the analysis framework, a benchmark network representative of a real gas transmission network across several countries of the European Union (EU) is considered. The information extracted from such analysis can help us to identify the critical elements and how the properties of the network are affected by failures, and to propose corresponding improvements for CIs. The findings of this paper demonstrate the interest of considering several perspectives in the analysis of CIs for providing useful information for ensuring their safe and reliable operation.

The mainstream DL architectures, for example, Csi- Net, deploy DL models on the base station (BS) side and the user equipment (UE) side, which are highly coupled and need to be trained jointly. However, two-sided DL models require collaborations between different network vendors and UE vendors, which entail considerable challenges in order to achieve consensus, for example, model maintenance and responsibility. Furthermore, DL-based CSI feedback design invokes DL to reduce only the CSI feedback error, whereas jointly optimizing several modules at the transceivers would provide more significant gains. This article presents DL-based CSI feedback from the perspectives of a one-sided model and joint multi-module learning. We herein introduce various novel one-sided CSI feedback architectures. In particular, the recently proposed CSI feedback algorithm, based on the plug-and-play priors framework, provides a one-sided one-for-all framework, which enables a DL model to deal with arbitrary CSI compression ratios. We review the different joint multi-module learning methods, where the CSI feedback module is learned jointly with other modules, including channel coding, channel estimation, pilot design, and precoding design. Finally, future directions and challenges for DL-based CSI feedback are discussed from the perspectives of inherent limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) and practical deployment issues.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0163-6804	1558-1896										Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaSamsung R&D Inst China Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaQueens Univ, Belfast, North Ireland	Samsung R&D Inst China Beijing			2025-01-03	WOS:001385733500001

Existing methods typically construct these representations by projecting feature vectors and sparse label vectors into a shared latent space and aligning them, but they overlook the semantic information within labels. Moreover, they commonly model label-related representations as deterministic vectors. In contrast, probabilistic latent variable modeling tends to capture richer information and improve model robustness. In light of these observations, this paper proposes a variational inference framework for constructing and leveraging informative label-related representations, presenting a deep conditional generative model for multi-label classification built upon this framework. Specifically, label-related representations are formulated as two variables within a probabilistic latent space from the dual perspectives of label semantics and feature priors, with KL divergence used to align their posterior and prior distributions. The two variables are then fused to enhance feature representation, which is subsequently fed into a generator to model the conditional label distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0950-7051	1872-7409										Shanxi Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Technol, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Univ, Inst Big Data Sci & Ind, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Univ, Key Lab Computat Intelligence & Chinese Informat P, Minist Educ, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R ChinaShanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Taiyuan 030006, Peoples R China				2024-12-28	WOS:001381285100001

In response, a small target detection algorithm that fuses multi-scale complementary features, named MCFNet is proposed. Firstly, in order to independently extract the unimodal features of visible light and infrared images and effectively enhance the complementary information between images, a dual-stream backbone network with a terminal fusion mechanism is proposed. Secondly, the complementary feature information residual module is utilized to optimize the integration process of residual features. Subsequently, by designing a multi-scale feature enhancement module the network's capability to capture multi-scale features is enhanced. Finally, for targets of varying sizes, a lightweight Transformer feature extraction module is proposed to improve the detection accuracy of small targets from a drone's perspective. Test results on the drone-vehicle dataset show that this method achieved an average detection accuracy of 67.92%, while the detection accuracy on the self-constructed UAV-data dataset reached 96.4%. Additionally, a series of ablation experiments validated the effectiveness of the different modules.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-9659	1751-9667										Jiangsu Union Tech Inst, Xuzhou Finance & Econ Branch, Xuzhou, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Min & Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China	Jiangsu Union Tech Inst			2025-01-19	WOS:001396282800001

It ranks the relative importance of these factors and measures generational differences on the impact of SMIs. Data from 628 respondents obtained via an online survey was analyzed using a dual-stage multi-group structural equation model (SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. The SEM revealed that SMIs' intimate self-disclosure, environmental concern, and spending self-control positively affected sustainable food purchase intention by mediating social and epistemic values. A multi-group analysis of the SEM found no significant generational differences. The ANN indicated that consumer purchases of sustainable food were primarily associated with SMIs' spending self-control followed by their environmental concern. The ANN predicted consumer sustainable food purchase intention with 99.4% accuracy. Theoretically, this study enhances the knowledge of how consumers internalize social media influencer marketing (SMIM) and encourages their endorsement of sustainable foods by introducing TCV into the SOR framework. It also refutes the view that SMIs are significant only for younger generations and reveals the relative importance of SMIs impact factors from a non-linear perspective. From a practical perspective, we offer a specific SMIM investment strategy to maximize consumers' sustainable food purchases and several persuasive strategies for SMIs as opinion leaders. From a societal perspective, this research promotes sustainable development, human health, and a sustainable food economy.									37	0	0	0	2	0	37			0959-6526	1879-1786										Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Commun, George Town 11800, MalaysiaAnhui Univ Technol, Sch Business, Maanshan 243099, Peoples R ChinaXihua Univ, Sch Management, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China				2023-08-04	WOS:001033867000001

As a collaborative technology ED whiteboards are usually placed in the dynamic centre of the ED, and all ED staff will approach the whiteboard regularly to organize their individual yet interdependent work. Currently, digital whiteboards are replacing the ordinary dry-erase whiteboards in EDs, which bring the design and use of whiteboards in ED to our attention. Previous studies have applied the theoretical lenses of common information spaces, coordination, and awareness to the investigation of whiteboard use and design. Based on an ethnographic study of the work practices involving two differently designed ED whiteboards, we found these concepts insufficient to explain one essential characteristic of these heterogeneous artefacts. In this paper, we suggest an additional theoretical concept describing this characteristic of heterogeneous artefacts; namely artefactual multiplicity. Artefactual multiplicity identifies not only the multiple functions of heterogeneous artefacts but also the intricate relations between these multiple functionalities.									35	0	0	0	3	0	37			0925-9724	1573-7551										IT Univ Copenhagen, Copenhagen 2300, DenmarkRoskilde Univ, DK-4000 Roskilde, Denmark				2011-03-18	WOS:000287244300004

In addition, there exist other problems, such as difficulty in feature extraction and small sample size. In order to address above difficulties, this paper proposes a multi-perspective convolutional neural network model, which contains channel attention module and spatial attention module. The proposed modules derive attention graphs from channel dimension and spatial dimension respectively, then the input features are selectively learned according to the importance of the features. We explain how the gain in storage can be traded against a loss in accuracy and/or an increase in CPU cost. In addition, we give the interpretability of the model at multiple scales. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy of our proposed model can be improved by up to 3.8% and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1820-0214	2406-1018										Jiangnan Univ, Sch Internet Things Engn, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R ChinaChina Ship Sci Res Ctr, Wuxi 214122, Peoples R ChinaJiangnan Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence & Comp Sci, Wuxi, Peoples R China				2023-05-11	WOS:000975016500011

Previous span-based methods often struggle with accurately identifying the boundaries of aspect and opinion terms, especially when multiple word spans appear in a sentence. This limitation arises from their reliance on a single, simplistic approach to constructing contextual features. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Perspective Boundary Enhancement Network (MPBE). The network captures rich contextual features by adopting a dual-encoder mechanism and constructs multiple channels to further enhance these features. Specifically, we introduce enhanced semantic and syntactic information in two channels, while the third channel transforms the features using discrete fourier transform. In addition, we design a dual-graph cross fusion module to fuse features from different channels for more efficient information interaction and integration. Finally, by statistically analyzing the length distribution of aspect and opinion terms, a candidate length-based decoding strategy is proposed to achieve more accurate decoding. In experiments, the proposed MPBE model achieved excellent results on four benchmark datasets (14Lap, 14Res, 15Res, 16Res), with F1 scores of 62.32%, 73.78%, 65.32%, and 73.36%, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of the method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-669X	1573-7497										XiHua Univ, Sch Comp & Software Engn, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R ChinaChina Mobile Grp Design Inst Co Ltd, Sichuan Branch, Chengdu 610045, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaGuizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Coll Big Data Stat, Guizhou, Peoples R China				2025-01-21	WOS:001395697100007

In this work, the quantitative analysis methods for trace elements under complex alloy matrices by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are studied, which provide a foundation for utilizing LIBS technology in the rapid online detection of steel alloy properties. To improve the quantitative analysis accuracy of LIBS, deep learning algorithm methods are introduced. Given the characteristics of LIBS spectra, we explore multi-perspective feature extraction and backward differential methods to extract the spatio-temporal characteristics of LIBS spectra. The Text Convolutional Neural Network (TextCNN) model, combined with multi-perspective feature extraction, displays good stability and lower average relative errors (6.988% for Si, 6.280% for Mn) in the test set compared to the traditional quantitative analysis method and deep neural network (DNN) model. Finally, the backward differential method is employed to optimize the two-dimensional LIBS spectral input matrix, and the results indicate that the average relative errors of Si and Mn elements in the test set decrease to 5.139% and 3.939%, respectively.

Knowledge engineers have found it expeditious to break down large (monolithic) ontologies to work with smaller fragments. Ontology modularization is the process of extracting a fragment, or "module", from an ontology, based on predefined requirements. Due to both the diversity in ontological representations and motivations for modularizing, the body of research on ontology modularization techniques has become extremely large and may be intimidating to the novice ontology researcher. The objective of the paper is to present a comprehensive, albeit high-level, review of ontology modularization techniques. A systematic literature review covering January 1st 2000 to July 31st 2020 was performed to find and classify papers on ontology modularization techniques. The techniques exhibiting certain properties with respect to several features were assessed, and the modularization techniques were classified with a multi-dimensional perspective. The classifications are intended to guide one to a suitable modularization process in accordance with the requirements. The limitations of ontology modularization techniques are highlighted in the conclusion, and characteristics of a desirable framework for an ontology representation that would be best-suited for modularization are presented.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1041-4347	1558-2191										McMaster Univ, Dept Comp & Software, Hamilton L8S 4L8, ON, CanadaSheridan Coll, Fac Appl Sci & Technol, Oakville, ON L6H 2L1, CanadaSt Francis Xavier Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Antagonish, NS B2G 2W5, Canada	Sheridan Coll			2023-05-24	WOS:000964880800002

It occurs when multiple models achieve similar performance on a dataset but produce different predictions, resulting in predictive multiplicity. This is especially problematic in high-stakes environments, where arbitrary model outcomes can have serious consequences. Traditional model selection methods prioritize accuracy and fail to address this issue. Factors such as class imbalance and irrelevant variables further complicate the situation, making it harder for models to provide trustworthy predictions. Data-centric AI approaches can mitigate these problems by prioritizing data optimization, particularly through preprocessing techniques. However, recent studies suggest preprocessing methods may inadvertently inflate predictive multiplicity. This paper investigates how data preprocessing techniques like balancing and filtering methods impact predictive multiplicity and model stability, considering the complexity of the data. We conduct the experiments on 21 real-world datasets, applying various balancing and filtering techniques, and assess the level of predictive multiplicity introduced by these methods by leveraging the Rashomon effect. Additionally, we examine how filtering techniques reduce redundancy and enhance model generalization. The findings provide insights into the relationship between balancing methods, data complexity, and predictive multiplicity, demonstrating how data-centric AI strategies can improve model performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-2535	1872-6305										Eskisehir Tech Univ, Dept Stat, TR-26555 Eskisehir, TurkiyeWarsaw Univ Technol, Fac Math & Informat Sci, PL-00662 Warsaw, PolandUniv Warsaw, Fac Math Informat & Mech, PL-02097 Warsaw, Poland				2025-05-25	WOS:001492625000003

Multiple doses of the investigational product and multiple efficacy endpoints are often studied in randomized clinical trials and multiplicity adjustment needs to be considered in the sample size calculations. In this paper, I show how to perform sample size calculations with multiplicity adjustment for longitudinal clinical trials with missing data by converting longitudinal data with missing data to cross-sectional data without missing data. The proposed approach can drastically simplify the simulation work and facilitate the evaluation of power for various scenarios.

We study high-multiplicityN-fold IPs, which encode IPs succinctly by presenting a description of each block type and a vector of block multiplicities. Our goal is to design algorithms which solve N-fold IPs in time polynomial in the size of the succinct encoding, which may be significantly smaller than the size of the explicit (non-succinct) instance. We present the first fixed-parameter algorithm for high-multiplicity N-fold IPs, which even works for convex objectives. Our key contribution is a novel proximity theorem which relates fractional and integer optima of the Configuration LP, a fundamental notion by Gilmore and Gomory [Oper. Res., 1961] which we generalize. Our algorithm for N-fold IP is faster than previous algorithms whenever the number of blocks is much larger than the number of block types, such as in N-fold IP models for various scheduling problems.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0025-5610	1436-4646										Czech Tech Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Theoret Comp Sci, Prague, Czech RepublicCharles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Comp Sci Inst, Prague, Czech RepublicTechnion Israel Inst Technol, Haifa, IsraelHamburg Univ Technol, Inst Algorithms & Complex, Hamburg, Germany				2022-09-27	WOS:000855987900002		
J	Malinen, Ilkka; Tanskanen, Juha										Homotopy parameter bounding in increasing the robustness of homotopy continuation methods in multiplicity studies								COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				34	11			1761	1774				10.1016/j.compchemeng.2010.03.013							Article	NOV 8 2010	2010	Homotopy continuation methods are globally convergent methods, which can also be utilized in multiplicity studies. However, when the starting point and/or solution multiplicities lie on separate homotopy path branches, one or more of the solutions may be missed. This is due to the absence of real space connections between separate homotopy path branches, thus preventing multiple solutions being reached from a single starting point. In this paper, a concept is presented that enables a tracking starting point and solution multiplicities in cases where the standard problem-independent homotopy method fails. The concept is based on homotopy parameter bounding and enables the connection of separate homotopy path branches. The concept performance is examined using distillation column examples. In the examined cases the concept is found to improve robustness by establishing a path in real space such that solutions are approached that would be unattainable using the standard homotopy method.

Retransmissions are applied to achieve the necessary diversity level to determine the collision multiplicity blindly, whose proper detection is essential for good resolution performance. The so-called network-assisted diversity multiple access (NDMA) employs the rank test (RT) method for blind multiplicity detection, but static channel parameters throughout the retransmissions and the tight control of the transmitter phase are required. In this paper, a superior blind collision multiplicity-detection technique is introduced by combining the minimum description length criterion and a variation of the RT method. Collision resolution is accomplished through independent component analysis (ICA). Unlike blind NDMA, the new protocol, named ICA-NDNIA, works in quasi-static fading channels, and does not need any phase control. Extensive performance analyses corroborate the performance advantages offered by ICA-NDMA.					19th International Symposium on Computer and Information Systems19th International Symposium on Computer and Information Systems	OCT, 2004OCT, 2004		Kemer, TURKEYKemer, TURKEY	19	2	0	0	0	0	25			0090-6778	1558-0857										Bogazici Univ, Wireless Commun Lab, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey				2006-05-01	WOS:000237852500015

Although MCS provides more benefits than single-channel shopping, there is a need to investigate consumer values in the MCS context. This study aims to develop a consumer value hierarchy that represents how consumers think and pursue when performing MCS.Design/methodology/approach - The research framework was developed from a perspective of means-end theory. Two studies were designed to elicit and evaluate a consumer value hierarchy of MCS. First, a qualitative study was conducted to explore means-end elements of MCS. Then, a hierarchical value map of MCS was constructed with 314 usable responses from an empirical survey in Taiwan. The impacts of past shopping experience on consumers' value perceptions were also examined.Findings - In the hierarchical value map (HVM) of MCS, the results indicate 18 means-end chains from ten MCS attributes resulting in nine consequences derived from those attributes, and then to four MCS values. The results also show that both expert and novice shoppers emphasize the utilitarian value of MCS; however, shopping novices pay more attention to the hedonic value of MCS than experts do.Practical implications - This paper provides several managerial implications for multi-channel retailers. Multi-channel retailers need to know more about the attributes and functions of each channel that they offer in order to create a superior shopping experience for their customers. Also, retailers need to understand different MCS patterns for successful multi-channel customer relationship management. Finally, the consumer value hierarchy of MCS is a useful tool for retailers to develop effective promotion strategies to increase customers' engagement in MCS.Originality/value - This paper is the first to apply means-end theory to investigate consumer value in the MCS context. It advances the consumer value literature in explaining a novel type of consumer channel-mixing behavior. The paper concludes with implications for multi-channel retailers, and future directions for MCS research are also discussed.									55	0	0	0	1	0	64			1066-2243											Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst, Taipei 11623, TaiwanNatl Tsing Hua Univ, Inst Serv Sci, Hsinchu, TaiwanNatl Chengchi Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taipei 11623, TaiwanNatl Chengchi Univ, Innovat & Incubat Ctr, Taipei 11623, Taiwan				2012-09-19	WOS:000307611400004

J	Zhang, Qichen; Li, Jingmei										A multi-perspective global-local interaction framework for identifying dialogue acts and sentiments of dialogue utterances jointly								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS				15	5			1995	2011				10.1007/s13042-023-02010-5					NOV 2023		Article	MAY 2024	2024	Dialogue act recognition (DAR) and sentiment classification (SC) are crucial tasks in dialogue systems, aiming to uncover speakers' implicit intentions and sentiment by analyzing contextual information. Recent approaches have sought to improve accuracy by jointly modeling dialogue acts and sentiments, considering complex relationships and latent structures. However, these methods often neglect two critical challenges. Firstly, real-world dialogues follow a chronological order, with interlocutors discussing one or more topics. Secondly, the joint task of dialogue act recognition and sentiment classification operates at a sentence level, making it essential to effectively utilize fine-grained word-level information from utterances. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-perspective global-local interaction framework. It captures overall contextual information and simulates the flow of dialogue acts and sentiments for each speaker. We delve into explicit intra-task interactions, cross-task collaborations, and token-level information reuse from three perspectives. We also incorporate a time span to accommodate real-world scenarios with chronological and multi-topic dialogues. Experimental results on widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over mainstream approaches. Comprehensive analysis validates the effectiveness of each component, showcasing the potential for enhancing DAR and SC tasks.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1868-8071	1868-808X										Harbin Engn Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, 145 Nantong St, Harbin 150001, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China				2023-12-03	WOS:001100066300001

Although existing methods have made significant progress in fine-grained intra- and inter-modal representations, they failed to comprehensively consider the redundancy of the entire video relative to the target segment and the fact that interactions could obscure crucial intra-modal information, which leads to the degradation of model performance. In this paper, we proposed a novel Parameterized Multi-Perspective Graph Learning Network for Temporal Sentence Grounding in Videos. Specifically, to effectively handle redundant information in video graphs, the concept of a parameterized network is introduced to dynamically construct new video graphs. Parameterizing the graph structure, making it adaptable to various video scenes while suppressing unnecessary redundant information. Furthermore, we designed a dual-path attention gating module that delves into cross-modal relationships while fully considering intra-modal information. The mechanism simultaneously considers the association between video and query from both inter- and intra-modal perspectives. This method allowed the model to better balance the local and global semantic consistency, further enhancing its representation capability for multimodal data. Extensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions and Tacos benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-669X	1573-7497										Gansu Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Cyberspace Secur, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China				2024-07-06	WOS:001253036300002

It is based on the simultaneous evaluation of the statistical significance of the maximum likelihood ratio test statistic over a large collection of potential clusters. In most cluster detection problems, there is variation in the extent of local multiplicity across the study region. For example, using a fixed maximum geographic radius for clusters, urban areas typically have many overlapping potential clusters, whereas rural areas have relatively few. The spatial scan statistic does not account for local multiplicity variation. We describe a previously proposed local multiplicity adjustment based on a nested Bonferroni correction and propose a novel adjustment based on a Gumbel distribution approximation to the distribution of a local scan statistic. We compare the performance of all three statistics in terms of power and a novel unbiased cluster detection criterion. These methods are then applied to the well-known New York leukemia dataset and a Wisconsin breast cancer incidence dataset.									8	0	0	0	4	0	11			0006-341X											Univ Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53726 USAUniv Wisconsin, Dept Populat Hlth Sci, Madison, WI 53726 USA				2012-03-01	WOS:000301924400020	21762118

While urban system initiatives have been implemented in practice, theoretical gaps remain at the operational design level. A theoretical framework is developed, based on design criteria identified from a critical synthesis of supply chain and operations management literature, and 'operationalised' using an in-depth case study demonstrating implementation of a Consumer Choice Portal-Package Consolidation Centre solution, within a densely populated urban geography. Findings suggest that there is a need to re-define the role of institutional actors beyond that of the traditional governance task, to one of being able to facilitate performance outcomes. Similarly, industrial efficiency dimensions need to be reorientated to include consumer participation, social considerations and multi-stakeholder service outcomes. Finally, implications for operations theory and practising managers in city logistics are highlighted, with suggested directions for future research.									52	1	0	0	2	0	58			0953-7287	1366-5871										Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Sch Technol, Inst Mfg IfM,Ctr Int Mfg, Cambridge CB2 1PZ, England				2016-01-01	WOS:000374632300004

Increasingly, geographically dispersed subsidiaries need to function as neural networks, reverse transferring knowledge to headquarters. This study explores the attributes that stimulate reverse knowledge transfer within MNEs. Firstly, a multi-perspective model of reverse knowledge transfer (RKT) is created conceptualising the process as predicated upon knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. Constructs of this model are then operationalised within Coats plc, a UK based multinational and global market leader in the textile industry. A key benefit of the proposed new model is that it allows for maps of capabilities in RKT to be created. This has important implications for management practice by providing managers with a potentially significant tool for strategic analysis based upon an integrative perspective on factors underpinning RKT.

To solve these problems, we propose a multi-perspective convolutional neural network (Multi-PerNet) to extract remote sensing imagery features. Regions with CNN features (R-CNN) is a milestone in applying CNN method to object detection. With the help of the great feature extraction and classification performance of CNN, the transformation of object detection problem is realized by the Region Proposal method. Multi-PerNet trains a vehicle object detection model in remote sensing imagery based on Faster R-CNN. During model training, sample images and the labels are inputs, and the output is a detection model. First, Multi-PerNet extracts the feature map. Meanwhile, the area distribution and object-area aspect ratio in the sample images are obtained by k-means clustering. Then, the Faster R-CNN region proposal network generates the candidate windows based on the k-means clustering results. Features of candidate windows can be obtained by mapping candidate windows to the feature map. Finally, the candidate window and its features are inputted to the classifier to be trained to obtain the detection model. Experiment results show that the Multi-PerNet model detection accuracy is improved by 10.1% compared with the model obtained by ZF-net and 1.6% compared with the model obtained by PVANet. Moreover, the model size is reduced by 21.3%.									10	2	0	0	2	0	14				2220-9964										Wuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Safety Engn Technol Res Ctr Hubei Prov, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Wuhan 430081, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China				2018-12-28	WOS:000445150900016

In this research, the utilization of constrained interval type -2 fuzzy sets (CIT2 FSs) enables the representation of complex uncertainty in decision information, and a space analysis approach, called CIT2 fuzzy multi -criteria acceptability analysis (CIT2FMAA), is proposed for conducting reliable decision -making. The CIT2FMAA introduces a novel paradigm for type -2 fuzzy decision -making, wherein CIT2 fuzzy evaluations are acknowledged as spaces of type -1 fuzzy evaluations and processed using type -1 fuzzy operations and methodologies. First, from a space analysis perspective, the type -2 fuzzy measures of logical rank expressions are formalized as CIT2 fuzzy rank acceptability indexes, and the CIT2 fuzzy rank acceptability analysis is developed to rank CIT2 fuzzy numbers. Second, the weighted average of the CIT2 fuzzy numbers is defined, and the CIT2FMAA is proposed to support uncertain multi -criteria decision -making. Subsequently, a sampling algorithm is designed for implementing CIT2 fuzzy rank acceptability analysis and CIT2FMAA. Finally, a linguistic disease diagnosis is performed to demonstrate the efficiency of CIT2FMAA. Compared to traditional type -2 fuzzy decision -making methods, CIT2FMAA is more efficient because it not only derives ranks of alternatives but also provides confidence degrees for those ranks.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0020-0255	1872-6291										Anhui Univ, Sch Big Data & Stat, Hefei 230601, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Univ, Ctr Appl Math, Hefei 230601, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Univ Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 1, Hefei 230031, Peoples R China				2024-06-06	WOS:001234846300001

Such an understanding can further aid in developing effective immunization programs for future pandemics. Unfortunately, there are numerous aspects to consider while determining whether to accept the vaccination, particularly from a cultural perspective. To achieve these objectives, we develop a novel culture-aware machine learning (ML) model for predicting vaccination willingness based on our new dataset. We next use advanced AI explainers such as the Probabilistic Graphical Model and Shapley Additive Explanations to analyze the most important and composite features contributing to the ML model's predictions. These investigations identify the key characteristics that are most likely to influence vaccination acceptance decisions.

Here, we proposed an interpretable method based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) that can recognize IWM. The proposed 1D CNN model obtained a test accuracy of 99.08%+/- 1.37% with five-time repetition and showed sensitivities and specificities per class within the range of 98%-99%. To shed light into the black-box nature of neural network, a multi-perspective interpretation of CNN algorithm towards the analysis of spectroscopy was performed to provide a more complete view of feature importance, intermediate outputs and decision process. As for identifying IWM, the most critical elements captured by the CNN using a visualization algorithm (class activation map) were Na, Mn, Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, K, Cr, Zn, F and Cl. In the intermediate outputs, it was found that the kernels in the same convolution extract different local informative variables and contribute to learning high-level features. In the final decision process, the CNN was proved to accumulate more valuable information over the increased convolutions using another visualization algorithm (tSNE) and the output was calculated through mathematical inference. This is the first study in which CNN-assisted LIBS spectroscopy was used to identify IWM while providing a multi-perspective interpretable method for CNN algorithm, which can lay a foundation for widening the application of CNN-based spectroscopic techniques in waste identification.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2213-2929	2213-3437										Shanghai Customs Dist, Tech Ctr Ind Prod & Raw Mat Inspect & Testing, Shanghai 200135, Peoples R ChinaQingdao Univ Technol, Qingdao 266520, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaTech Ctr Qingdao Customs, Qingdao 266109, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaUniv Shanghai Sci & Technol, Inst Bismuth & Rhenium, Sch Mat & Chem, Shanghai 200093, Peoples R ChinaTaizhou Pollut Control Technol Ctr Co Ltd, Taizhou 318000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China	Shanghai Customs DistTech Ctr Qingdao CustomsTaizhou Pollut Control Technol Ctr Co Ltd			2024-05-23	WOS:001224278400001

From a theoretical point of view, the paper explores service design with a Systems Thinking lens. A multi-contextual perspective aiming to analyze, decompose, and design smart cities services where resilience is an input at the service design level is described and the four diamondsof-context model for service design (4DocMod) is introduced. This service model accommodates various actors' contexts in public service design and consists of four design artefacts, the diamonds (See, Recognize, Organize, Do). From a practical point of view, guidelines for the application of the 4DocMod service model extension for resilience are described along with two case studies addressing the recent COVID-19 pandemic that illustrates a clear situation of resilience with insights in multiple contexts. According to the findings of this paper, it is obvious that resilience is not ``just'' a request. Instead, it plays a higher role within the service system. It is not ``just'' another Context, either. Instead, it goes through many contexts with different circumstances. In this manner, it is possible to address the qualities through which actors can become resilient, at the service design stage, to ensure continuity of the public services in times of emergency. As our approach using the 4DocMod is proposing, resilience may be is achieved when specific properties are provisioned at information service design level.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2169-3536											Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Fac Automat & Comp, Dept Automat & Syst Engn, Bucharest 060042, RomaniaMasaryk Univ, Fac Informat, Dept Comp Syst & Commun, Brno 60200, Czech RepublicUniv Salerno, Dept Business Sci Management & Innovat Syst, I-84084 Fisciano, ItalyHigher Inst Publ Hlth, Beirut 11042020, LebanonUCL, Bartlett, London WC1E 6BT, England	Higher Inst Publ Hlth			2020-11-09	WOS:000582338900001

Prompted by the remarkable generalization ability of prompt learning, recent studies have endeavoured to develop adaptive contextual prompts to adjust the representation spaces in visual emotion analysis dynamically. However, the majority of these studies have focused on non-oriented prompting strategies, overlooking the sentiment information associated with emotion labels. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Multi-Perspective Prompt Learning (MPP-CLIP), within the context of CLIP, for visual emotion analysis. Our approach not only involves non-oriented prompting using learnable contexts but also leverages emotion-oriented prompting based on emotion labels. Thus, our design facilitates a strong coupling between the vision-emotion features, ensuring mutual synergy and discouraging the adoption of solely non-oriented solutions. In addition, we introduce Residual-Enhanced Adapter, which employs residual-style feature mixing to achieve efficient transfer learning from pre-trained CLIP to visual emotion analysis. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while maintaining significantly lower computational and memory costs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0950-7051	1872-7409										China Univ Petr East China, Qingdao Inst Software, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Qingdao, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Petr Beijing Karamay, Karamay, Peoples R ChinaJD AI Res, Beijing, Peoples R China	JD AI Res			2024-08-30	WOS:001298533500001

The study is based on three workshops with local governance actors, six semi-structured interviews with academics in the fields of public participation and digital technologies and a citizen survey with 260 respondents. The results provide multi-perspective insights into the challenges of participatory processes and are synthesized into three contributions: (i) guidelines for effective public participation, including factors that encourage or discourage citizen engagement; (ii) guidelines for designing participatory platforms, highlighting specific features that promote digital engagement (i.e. social media, gamification and user-friendly interfaces), and (iii) a typology of digital participation platforms to connect the diverse needs of actor groups with the various possibilities provided by new technologies. The guidelines provide concrete recommendations to support both urban practitioners and interface designers in designing participatory strategies and platforms, respectively. Recognizing that there is no-one-size-fits-all platform, the typology provides a framework for the assessment and further development of digital platforms for public participation.This article is part of the theme issue 'Co-creating the future: participatory cities and digital governance'.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1364-503X	1471-2962										Delft Univ Technol, Dept Urbanism, NL-2628 BL Delft, NetherlandsDelft Univ Technol, Dept Multiactor Syst, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands				2024-11-23	WOS:001354351500010	39533909

J	Dvir, Zeev; Kopparty, Swastik; Saraf, Shubhangi; Sudan, Madhu										EXTENSIONS TO THE METHOD OF MULTIPLICITIES, WITH APPLICATIONS TO KAKEYA SETS AND MERGERS								SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING				42	6			2305	2328				10.1137/100783704							Article	2013	2013	We extend the "method of multiplicities" to get the following results, of interest in combinatorics and randomness extraction. (i) We show that every Kakeya set in F-q(n), the n-dimensional vector space over the finite field on q elements, must be of size at least q(n)/2(n). This bound is tight to within a 2 + o(1) factor for every n as q -> infinity. (ii) We give improved "randomness mergers": Mergers are seeded functions that take as input l (possibly correlated) random variables in {0, 1}(N) and a short random seed and output a single random variable in {0, 1}(N) that is statistically close to having entropy (1-delta) . N when one of the l input variables is distributed uniformly. The seed we require is only (1/delta) . log l-bits long, which significantly improves upon previous construction of mergers. (iii) We give improved randomness extractors, based on our improved mergers. Specifically, we show how to construct randomness extractors that use logarithmic length seeds while extracting 1 - o(1) fraction of the min-entropy of the source. Previous results could extract only a constant fraction of the entropy while maintaining logarithmic seed length. The "method of multiplicitie" was used in prior work to analyze combinatorial parameters of "algebraically nice" subsets of vector spaces over finite fields. The method works by constructing somewhat low-degree interpolating polynomials that vanish on every point in the subset with high multiplicity. The typical use of this method involves using the "algebraic niceness" to show that the interpolating polynomial also vanishes on some points outside the subset. It then uses simple bounds on the number of zeroes of low-degree polynomials to bound the combinatorial parameter of interest. Our augmentation to this technique is that we prove, under appropriate conditions, that the interpolating polynomial vanishes with high multiplicity outside the set. This novelty leads to significantly tighter analyses. To develop the extended method of multiplicities, we provide a number of basic technical results about multiplicity of zeroes of polynomials that may be of general use. For instance, we strengthen the Schwartz-Zippel lemma to show that the expected multiplicity of zeroes of a nonzero degree d polynomial at a random point in S-n, for any finite subset S of the underlying field, is at most d/vertical bar S vertical bar (a fact that does not seem to have been noticed in the CS literature before).									52	0	0	0	0	0	55			0097-5397	1095-7111										Princeton Univ, Inst Adv Study, Princeton, NJ 08540 USAMIT, CSAIL, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA				2014-01-22	WOS:000328889400012

Educating aspiring minds to meet highest standards in these facets is the mandate of institutions of higher education. This, naturally, includes the preparation for excelling in today's data-driven world. In recent years, an intensive academic discussion has resulted in the distinction between two different modes of data related education: data science and data literacy education. As a large number of study programs and offers is emerging around the world, data literacy in higher education is a particular focus of this paper. These programs, despite sharing the same name, differ substantially in their educational content, i.e., a high plurality can be observed. This paper explores this plurality, comments on the role it might play and suggests ways it can be dealt with by maintaining a high degree of adaptiveness and plurality while simultaneously establishing a consistent educational "essence". It identifies a skill set, data self-empowerment, as a potential part of this essence. Data science and literacy education are still experiencing changeability in their emergence as fields of study, while additionally being stirred up by rapid developments, bringing about a need for flexibility and dialectic.									2	0	0	0	0	0	3				2306-5729										Bielefeld Univ, BiCDaS, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany				2021-03-19	WOS:000622448300001

Recently, a new task named Causal Emotion Entailment (CEE) has been proposed to identify the causal utterances for the target emotional utterance in a conversation. Although researchers have achieved some progress in solving this problem, they failed to adequately incorporate speaker characteristics and overlooked the effects of temporal relations in conversation structures. To fill such a research gap to some extent, we propose a novel causal emotion entailment framework, namely MPEG (Multi-Perspective Enhanced Graph attention network). The training of MPEG consists of three stages. First, we utilize a speaker-aware pre-trained model and two attention mechanisms to obtain the utterance representations that incorporate local contexts as well as the speaker and emotional information. Then, these representations are fed into a graph attention network to model the conversation structures and emotional dynamics from both local and global perspectives. Finally, a fully-connected network is implemented to predict the relationships between emotional utterances and causal utterances. Experimental results show that MPEG achieves state-of-the-art performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1949-3045											Tongji Univ, Sch Software Engn, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R ChinaTongji Univ, Sch Humanities, Shanghai 200082, Peoples R China				2024-09-18	WOS:001308401200064

Relevant document retrieval is the backbone of the legal domain. The concept of relevance in the legal domain is very complex and multi-faceted. In this work, we propose a novel approach of concept based similarity estimation among court judgments. We use a graph-based method, to identify prominent concepts present in a judgment and extract sentences representative of these concepts. The sentences and concepts so mined are used to express/visualize likeness among concepts between a pair of documents from different perspectives. We also propose to aggregate the different levels of matching so obtained into one measure quantifying the level of similarity between a judgment pair. We employ the ordered weighted average (OWA) family of aggregation operators for obtaining the similarity value. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach of concept based similarity is effective in the extraction of relevant legal documents and performs better than other competing techniques. Additionally, the proposed two-level abstraction of similarity enables informative visualization for deeper insights into case relevance.									8	2	0	0	0	0	10				2376-5992										JAIN Deemed Be Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Bangalore, Karnataka, IndiaCMR Inst Technol, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Bangalore, Karnataka, India	CMR Inst Technol			2020-04-06	WOS:000521300600001	33816914

However, each data entry may reflect trivial individual differences among samples and also contain technical noise. Therefore, the certainty of each observed difference should be confirmed at earlier steps of the analyses, and statistical tests are frequently used for this purpose. Since microarrays analyze a huge number of genes simultaneously, concerns of multiplicity, i.e. the family wise error rate (FWER) and false discovery rate (FDR), have been raised in testing the data. To deal with these concerns, several compensation methodologies have been proposed, making the tests very conservative to the extent that arbitrary tuning of the threshold has been introduced to relax the conditions. Unexpectedly, however, the appropriateness of the test methodologies, the concerns of multiplicity, and the compensation methodologies have not been sufficiently confirmed.Results: The appropriateness was checked by means of coincidence between the methodologies' premises and the statistical characteristics of data found in two typical microarray platforms. As expected, normality was observed in within-group data differences, supporting application of t-test and F-test statistics. However, genes displayed their own tendencies in the magnitude of variations, and the distributions of p-values were rather complex. These characteristics are inconsistent with premises underlying the compensation methodologies, which assume that most of the null hypotheses are true. The evidence also raised concerns about multiplicity. In transcriptomic studies, FWER should not be critical, as analyses at higher levels would not be influenced by a few false positives. Additionally, the concerns for FDR are not suitable for the sharp null hypotheses on expression levels.Conclusions: Therefore, although compensation methods have been recommended to deal with the problem of multiplicity, the compensations are actually inappropriate for transcriptome analyses. Compensations are not only unnecessary, but will increase the occurrence of false negative errors, and arbitrary adjustment of the threshold damages the objectivity of the tests. Rather, the results of parametric tests should be evaluated directly.									17	0	0	0	10	0	18				1752-0509										Akita Prefectural Univ, Fac Bioresource Sci, Akita 0100195, Japan				2012-04-18	WOS:000301987000006	22784577

Data augmentation for knowledge-aware dialogue generation via multi-perspective sentences interaction☆								NEUROCOMPUTING				614						128724			10.1016/j.neucom.2024.128724					OCT 2024		Article	JAN 21 2025	2025	In recent years, knowledge-based dialogue generation has garnered significant attention due to its capacity to produce informative and coherent responses through the integration of external knowledge into models. However, obtaining high-quality knowledge that aligns with the dialogue content poses a considerable challenge, necessitating substantial time and resources. To tackle the issue of limited dialogue data, a majority of research endeavors concentrate on data augmentation to augment the volume of training data. Regrettably, these methods overlook knowledge augmentation, leading to a restricted diversity in input data and yielding enhancements solely in specific metrics. Real-world conversations exhibit a spectrum of characteristics, including repetitions, reversals, and interruptions, demanding a heightened level of data diversity. In this study, we introduce a straightforward yet effective data augmentation technique known as Multi-perspective Sentence Interaction to bolster the connections among sentences from varied viewpoints. Through an examination of target responses from multiple dialogue perspectives, we enhance our comprehension of the relationships between dialogue sentences, thereby facilitating the expansion of knowledge-based dialogue data. Through experiments conducted on various knowledge-based dialogue datasets and utilizing different models, our findings illustrate a notable enhancement in the quality of model generation facilitated by our method. Specifically, we observed a 3.5% enhancement in reply accuracy and a 0.1506 increase in diversity (DIST-2). Moreover, there was a substantial improvement in knowledge selection accuracy by 19.04% and a reduction in model perplexity by 31.48%.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0925-2312	1872-8286										Informat Engn Univ, Zhengzhou, Peoples R ChinaLab Adv Comp & Intelligence Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China	Lab Adv Comp & Intelligence Engn			2024-11-12	WOS:001348865600001

However, it only determines the granularity of the neighborhood from a feature perspective, while ignoring the influence of sample distribution on the granularity of the neighborhood. Moreover, the use of single and monotonic uncertainty measures limits its ability to obtain high-quality features in complex and large-scale data, as well as perform feature selection for high-dimensional data. To address these issues, we propose several improvements. Firstly, we construct a sample space state function to evaluate the influence of sample distribution on the granularity of the samples. Based on the state of the sample space, we then propose four perspectives of variable-granularity neighborhoods and define the upper and lower approximations for these neighborhoods. Additionally, we define the dependence of variable-granularity neighborhoods and the positive regions from an algebraic perspective. These definitions together form a comprehensive variable-granularity rough set model that can automatically adjust the granularity size according to the sample distribution and select high-quality features. Secondly, in order to comprehensively assess the uncertainty of data, we introduce the information and algebraic perspectives. We propose a multi-perspective mixed entropy measure in the variable-granularity rough set framework. Thirdly, to avoid the problem of selecting redundant features caused by using a monotonic evaluation function in classical neighborhood rough set feature selection algorithms, we propose a non-monotonic feature selection algorithm based on the individual perspective of samples and the mixed entropy measures of the variable-granularity rough set. Finally, to overcome the high time complexity of feature selection on high-dimensional data, we introduce Fish-Score as a preliminary dimensionality reduction technique. Experimental results on eleven datasets and using fifteen algorithms demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also effectively reduces the number of features.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0924-669X	1573-7497										Henan Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Xinxiang 453007, Peoples R ChinaEngn Lab Intelligence Business & Internet Things, Xinxiang 453007, Henan, Peoples R China	Engn Lab Intelligence Business & Internet Things			2023-12-17	WOS:001113699300001

In order to restrain the proliferation of multi-label classifier's hypothesis space, the current works focus on the application of global positive label correlation. However, the "black or white"mechanism ignore other possible forms of label correlation, such as negative or neutral correlation. By introducing the doctrine of the mean, three-way decision (3WD) theory provides a solution for in-depth research on local label correlation, and aims to handle the uncertainty of multi-label learning tasks. In this paper, a novel learning algorithm for multi-label joint classification, namely ML-3WD, is proposed by considering the 3WD label correlation from the perspective of samples. According to the weights of different features on any label, the comprehensive loss of each sample to three action strategies can be measured. Obviously, the 3WD rules for any label variable in multi-label output space is obtained. By aggregating the cutting thresholds between different labels, the division principles of 3WD label correlation are further established. Given any multi-label sample, the local fuzzy membership to co-occurrence or mutual state for label pair is examined based on kernelized fuzzy rough sets. The 3WD local label relevance of each sample is confirmed, that is, positive, negative or neutral. The global application strategy for multi-label classification is utilized to avoid over-fitting induced by local mining strategy. Based on the integral mean of the distribution of 3WD local label relevance in multi-label sample space, two different versions of empirical label relevance are constructed. By constraining the relative position between sub-separation hyperplanes, the 3WD label correlation distribution-based model for multi-label joint classification is designed.

Sustaining today's economy and societies depend on maintaining this mobility. However, this mobility also causes undesirable effects, especially in high urban population areas. Even though, higher priority is given to public transport in metropolitan areas, road network is still an important part of everyday commute and should be planned and managed with great care. In this study, we propose an optimisation methodology that would help the traffic authorities to better predict the results of strategic management decisions in a realistic traffic model. We formulate a bi-level multi-objective traffic optimisation model with a sustainability perspective. The upper level of the proposed model considers the traffic authority's management strategies while the lower level considers the traffic users' decisions. The lower level is modelled using the Stochastic User Equilibrium since it allows more realistic results than the deterministic one. A case study is provided to illustrate the proposed model. The proposed methodology provides an avenue for understanding the trade-offs among conflicting objectives and for designing an environmentally and socially sustainable transportation system. More importantly, it builds the foundation for an intelligent traffic management decision support system. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Current methods mainly adjust and compromise multiple code representations such as code sequence and code graph based on composite graph. However, sequential features extracted by graph are hardly sufficient to model the contextual semantic associations of the token sequence. Meanwhile, structural features of the code graph extracted by models based on Euclidean Graph Neural Network are difficult to fit the tree -like calling relationships between code lines. These limitations make it difficult to detect diverse vulnerabilities. In addition, most of the existing models ignore the type of code statement, which is closely associated with some specific vulnerability types. In this paper, we propose a Parallelism Framework with Hierarchical feature Enhancement for Multi -type Vulnerability Detection (PFHE-MVD). PFHE-MVD models program code from three parallel perspectives, containing sequence, code graph, and Abstract Syntax Tree statistic. Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Neural Network is integrated to model the top -down hierarchical calling structure in program code graph through hyperbolic space mapping. Besides, the statement type of code is embedded along with the code text to strengthen the identification ability for different types of vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that PFHE-MVD achieves new state-of-the-art results in multi -type vulnerability detection. PFHE-MVD captures tree -like hierarchical code structure feature and enhances the distinguishing ability for vulnerabilities by code statement type embedding.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0167-4048	1872-6208										Beijing Inst Technol, Informat Syst & Secur & Countermeasures Expt Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China				2024-04-18	WOS:001201869600001

IC includes human capital, organizational capital and social capital. Applying IC is essential for an organization's survival in a competitive industry such as news media. Reporters are vital human capital in news organizations. They are the knowledge workers who create and distribute news. They also represent social capital because they have to develop relationships with news sources from outside of the organization. However, it is difficult to tap and retain IC. A news organization loses both human and social capital whenever a reporter resigns or job-hops. This research examines the relationships between IC and reporters' performance from a multi-level perspective. We argue that the performance of an individual reporter is influenced by IC; moreover, job autonomy and team interdependence mediate the influence of IC on reporter performance. We collected 492 valid TV reporter samples from 44 teams, and used the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) to analyze the data. All hypotheses were supported, suggesting that the more the management pays attention to reporters' IC and their working conditions (i.e., job autonomy and task interdependence), the higher the performance of reporters. The implications for team collaborative learning and interaction are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explores the contextual meanings of the term "pattern" in the biomedical literature, compares them to existing definitions, annotates a corpus for use in machine learning and proposes new definitions of terms such as "Syndrome, feature" and "pattern recognition."Design/methodology/approachEntrez API was used to retrieve articles form PubMed for the study which assembled a corpus of 398 articles using a search query for the ambiguous term "pattern" in the titles or abstracts. The python NLTK library was used to extract the terms and their contexts, and an expert check was carried out. To understand the various meanings of the term, the contextual environment was analyzed by extracting the surrounding words of the term. The expert determined the appropriate size of the context for analysis to gain a more nuanced understanding of the different meanings of the term pattern.FindingsThe study found that the categories of meanings of the term "pattern" are broader in biomedical publications than in common definitions, and new categories have been emerging from the term's use in the biomedical field. The study highlights the importance of annotated corpora in advancing natural language processing techniques and provides valuable insights into the nuances of biomedical language.Originality/valueThe study's findings demonstrate the importance of exploring contextual meanings and proposing new definitions of terms in the biomedical field to improve natural language processing techniques.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0368-492X	1758-7883										Russian New Univ, Inst Informat Syst & Engn Comp Technol, Moscow, RussiaRussian New Univ, Dept Informat Syst Econ & Control, Moscow, RussiaSharda Univ, Dept Gen Management, Greater Noida, India				2023-08-07	WOS:001033691700001

This is even more so, especially in the case of supranational TIS, where an additional source and layer of potential conflicts is added by a supranational body, such as the EU, which can impose TIS by law. This paper seeks to explore "how to understand conflicts that occur when developing and implementing supranational TIS." Understanding conflicts can help TIS managers to take proactive, rather than reactive, measures to handling conflict situations that they encounter. We propose a multi-level conflict management framework and utilize an interpretive case study methodology to demonstrate how it can be applied in the context of one supranational TIS (a transit system that was introduced in the EU), taking the management perspective of one national government (here the Netherlands). Our findings indicate that the national government simultaneously faces multiple conflicts as it is positioned between the supranational body, its own IT department, and national businesses. Unlike TIS studies reporting avoidance as a viable strategy in the early stages of TIS development, our study implies that when the deadline approaches, there is little room for avoiding conflicts; rather, they are faced and addressed promptly. This study provides a novel theoretical perspective to analyzing TIS management, and contributes to the efforts of developing methods and tools to aid TIS managers in their practices.

This study presents a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity knowledge discovery through topic modelling, using a multi-perspective analysis of academic and industry sources. The datasets include 15,751 articles from the Web of Science (WoS) database and 5,831 articles from Security Magazine, spanning from 2011 to 2023. We employed BERTopic for topic modelling, UMAP for dimensionality reduction, and HDBSCAN clustering algorithm for grouping and analysing distinct article clusters to uncover latent topics, enhancing the understanding of the evolving cybersecurity landscape. This study found 12 micro-clusters and three macro-clusters, namely technology, smart city and education, from the WoS database and 12 more micro- clusters and four macro-clusters, including organization, public security, governance, and education, from magazines. This study reveals key cybersecurity research and practice trends, such as the increasing focus on malware, ransomware, and cyber-attack mitigation. Additionally, temporal analysis indicates a significant rise in cybersecurity interest around 2020, followed by a diversification of topics. The results highlight the importance of integrating diverse data sources to capture a holistic view of cybersecurity developments. Future work will aim to refine the clustering algorithms to further improve topic extraction and analysis and expand the datasets to include more diverse sources and perspectives. This approach helps discover current cybersecurity trends and provides a foundation for more targeted and effective cybersecurity strategies.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1110-0168	2090-2670										King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia				2024-08-07	WOS:001281036100001

This problem can be seen both from a computer algebra and a coding theory point of view. In computer algebra, this is a generalization of Simultaneous Rational Function Recon-struction with errors and multiprecision evaluations. From an error correcting codes point of view, this problem is related to the de-coding of some algebraic codes such as Reed-Solomon, Derivatives or Multiplicity codes. We give conditions on the inputs of the prob-lem which guarantee the uniqueness of the interpolant. Since we deal with rational functions, some evaluation points may be poles: a first contribution of this work is to correct any error in a scenario with poles and multiplicities that extends (Kaltofen et al., 2020). Our second contribution is to adapt rational func-tion reconstruction for random errors, and provide better conditions for uniqueness using interleaving techniques as in (Guerrini et al., 2021).(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem has been extended to three or more variables; for this generalization, all fast algorithms proposed so far rely on the lattice approach. In this paper, we reduce this multivariate interpolation problem to a problem of simultaneous polynomial approximations, which we solve using fast structured linear algebra. This improves the best known complexity bounds for the interpolation step of the list-decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, Parvaresh-Vardy codes, and folded Reed-Solomon codes. In particular, for Reed-Solomon list-decoding with re-encoding, our approach has complexity O similar to (l(omega-1)m(2)(n - k)), where l, m, n, and k are the list size, the multiplicity, the number of sample points, and the dimension of the code, and. is the exponent of linear algebra; this accelerates the previously fastest known algorithm by a factor of l/m.									23	1	0	0	0	0	24			0018-9448	1557-9654										Univ Western Ontario, Dept Comp Sci, London, ON N6A 3K7, CanadaUniv Lyon, UCBL, Lab Informat Parallelisme, CNRS,ENS Lyon,Inria, F-69007 Lyon, France				2015-05-01	WOS:000353515700012

Usually, the design of augmentation policies faces a diversity-difficulty trade-off. On the one hand, a simple augmentation leads to a low training set diversity, which can not improve model performance significantly. On the other hand, an excessively hard augmentation has an overlarge regularization effect which harms model performance. Recently, automatic augmentation methods have been proposed to address this issue by searching the optimal data augmentation policy from a predefined searching space. However, these methods still suffer from heavy searching overhead or complex optimization objectives. In this paper, instead of searching the optimal augmentation policy, we propose to break the diversity-difficulty trade-off from a multi-task learning perspective. By formulating model learning on the augmented images and the original images as the auxiliary task and the primary task in multi-task learning respectively, the hard augmentation does not directly influence the training of the primary branch and thus its negative influence can be alleviated. Hence, neural networks can learn valuable semantic information even with a totally random augmentation policy. Experimental results on ten datasets for four tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the other twelve methods.

Some conventional e-books may not sufficiently encourage reflective thinking or foster CT skills due to their linear nature and lack of engaging elements. Employing the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM) within the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, this study highlights the integration of multimedia elements and the use of students' selfies to boost engagement and social presence in a digital learning environment. This study introduced selfie role-playing reading, along with group discussions from various perspectives as an innovative pedagogy to enhance cognitive presence within the CoI, ultimately enhancing learners' CT performance. Using a quasi-experimental design, 63 participants were grouped into single-perspective or multiple-perspective categories by narrative perspective exposure, and then engaged in online story discussions with worksheets. Reading performance was measured through a detailed examination of their CT patterns via behavioral sequential analysis. Results revealed that students in the multi-perspective groups demonstrated superior CT and reflective thinking levels, underscoring the potential of innovative e-book designs in enhancing CT. This study not only validates the importance of diverse narratives and role-playing in CT development, but also pioneers a method for analyzing such skills through behavioral sequence analysis. It signifies a leap in applying the PIM to multimedia e-book reading, offering insights for future educational strategies and CT assessment in the digital era.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0360-1315	1873-782X										Natl Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, Grad Inst Digital Learning & Educ, Taipei 106, TaiwanNatl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Foreign Languages, Yunlin 64002, TaiwanNatl Museum Marine Sci & Technol, Keelung 20248, TaiwanNatl Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hsinchu 300093, Taiwan	Natl Museum Marine Sci & Technol			2024-11-23	WOS:001356086300001

This task aims to effectively extract useful information on dynamic features. Although various existing works have achieved remarkable progress, the model performance can be further improved by fully extracting the trends, variations, and the correlation between the trends and variations in dynamic features. In addition, sparse visit records limit the performance of deep learning models. To address these issues, we propose the multi-perspective patient representation Extractor (MPRE) for disease prediction. Specifically, we propose frequency transformation module (FTM) to extract the trend and variation information of dynamic features in the time-frequency domain, which can enhance the feature representation. In the 2D multi-extraction network (2D MEN), we form the 2D temporal tensor based on trend and variation. Then, the correlations between trend and variation are captured by the proposed dilated operation. Moreover, we propose the first-order difference attention mechanism (FODAM) to calculate the contributions of differences in adjacent variations to the disease diagnosis adaptively. To evaluate the performance of MPRE and baseline methods, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets. The experiment results show that MPRE outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of AUROC and AUPRC.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0219-1377	0219-3116										Macao Polytech Univ, Fac Appl Sci, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R ChinaMacao Polytech Univ, Engn Res Ctr Appl Technol Machine Translat & Artif, Minist Educ, Macau, Peoples R ChinaUniv Bologna, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Bologna, ItalyUniv Calif Los Angeles, Dept Comp Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA				2024-09-08	WOS:001304403500002

Moreover, this paper also wishes to develop a new analysis paradigm of dynamic cooperation game to the micro-interactive mechanism research on individuals' knowledge sharing in organization.Design/methodology/approach Through comparing and referring to previous literatures, and considering the authentic knowledge cooperation practice, this paper first suggested that the behavior characteristics of knowledge sharing between individuals in organization should be observed from the perspective of dynamic cooperation game that would accurately describe the coopetition essence of knowledge sharing. Further, an intricate multi-analysis context including two different objective orientations and two different information conditions was constructed. Under this multi-analysis context, the objective functions of knowledge transferor (knowledge output) and knowledge receiver (knowledge returning) were established respectively. Lastly, according to the revenue optimum principle of organizational and individual the strategic choice characteristics were analyzed through the Nash equilibrium to analyze objective functions.Findings Knowledge transaction motive is classic strategic characteristic of individuals' knowledge cooperation, and to increase competitiveness of knowledge sharer is a crucial prerequisite for knowledge sharing under any analysis context combination (no matter organizational or individual objective, no matter perfect or imperfect information). Knowledge sharing appears more conservative and stringent under imperfect information condition, and the effort level of knowledge transferring is strategically adjusted according to the value assessment of received knowledge. The institutional constraints and incentives have little effect on the promotion of knowledge sharing under the imperfect information condition where professional knowledge is more intricate, personalized and implicit, because organization members are more sensitive to knowledge competitiveness.Originality/value This paper provides a knowledge sharing study with a new analysis paradigm from micro-interactive perspective by aiming at the coopetition essence of knowledge cooperation in organization. This analysis paradigm chooses the way of dynamic cooperation game to reveal the strategic characteristics of knowledge sharing among individuals (knowledge transferor and knowledge receiver) and to assess the role of institutional constraints and incentives in promoting the knowledge sharing.

Previous work in this area demonstrates that the 'internal' alignment of actors is critical to value creation in the innovation ecosystem. However, the literature has largely overlooked that the success of an innovation ecosystem also depends on its 'external' viability, determined by the broader sociotechnical environment. That is, path-breaking innovations inherently challenge the prevailing socio-technical regime in a domain (e.g., established rules, artifacts and habits) that tends to be resistant to change. Overcoming this resistance is a major challenge for ventures pioneering path-breaking innovations. The paper contributes to the literature on innovation ecosystems by explicitly considering the socio-technical viability of the innovation ecosystem around a path-breaking innovation. In particular, we theorize about the objects of manipulation in an innovation ecosystem and discuss the strategies that a focal venture, orchestrating the innovation ecosystem, can employ in manipulating these objects so as to increase the socio-technical viability of the ecosystem. We arrive at a multi-level perspective on innovation ecosystem development that integrates internal alignment and external viability and informs a research agenda for future studies in this field.									200	12	0	0	8	2	218			0040-1625	1873-5509										Eindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, POB 513, NL-5600 MB Eindhoven, Netherlands				2018-12-28	WOS:000449899100008		
J	Bertsimas, D; Gamarnik, D; Sethuraman, J										From fluid relaxations to practical algorithms for high-multiplicity job-shop scheduling: The holding cost objective								OPERATIONS RESEARCH				51	5			798	813				10.1287/opre.51.5.798.16748							Article	SEP-OCT 2003	2003	We design an algorithm for the high-multiplicity job-shop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing the total holding cost by appropriately rounding an optimal solution to a fluid relaxation in which we replace discrete jobs with the flow of a continuous fluid. The algorithm solves the fluid relaxation optimally and then aims to keep the schedule in the discrete network close to the schedule given by the fluid relaxation. If the number of jobs from each type grow linearly with N, then the algorithm is within an additive factor O(N) from the optimal (which scales as O(N-2)); thus, it is asymptotically optimal. We report computational results on benchmark instances chosen from the OR library comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm and several commonly used heuristic methods. These results suggest that for problems of moderate to high multiplicity, the proposed algorithm outperforms these methods, and for very high multiplicity the overperformance is dramatic. For problems of low to moderate multiplicity, however, the relative errors of the heuristic methods are comparable to those of the proposed algorithm, and the best of these methods performs better overall than the proposed method.									27	1	0	0	0	0	35			0030-364X											MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAMIT, Ctr Operat Res, Cambridge, MA 02139 USAIBM Corp, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, Yorktown Hts, NY 10598 USAColumbia Univ, Dept Ind Engn & Operat Res, New York, NY 10027 USA				2003-09-01	WOS:000185681900009

When the LP problem has multiple optima, the LP solvers usually only report the first optimum that it is reached which may not fit well the experimental data. To tackle this primal multiplicity problem, the weighted primal-dual method with auxiliary parameters is used to calculate a unique time trajectory for a given set of initial conditions. Through tuning of these auxiliary parameters, a unique optimal solution can be obtained and calibrated to fit available experimental data. Beyond its capability to tackle multiplicity, the algorithm is shown to significantly improve the prediction of some metabolites in a case study of the fed-batch fermentation of Bordetella pertussis.

Conversely, images from cameras can provide rich semantic information, which makes these small-sized objects easy to be detected. To take use of the advantages of both devices to achieve better 3D object detection, research on the fusion of LiDAR and camera information is now being conducted. The existing fusion methods between point clouds and image are normally weighed more on the point clouds. Hence the semantic information of images is not fully utilized. We propose a new fusion method named PVFusion to try to fuse more image features. We first divide each point into a separate perspective voxel and project the voxel onto the image feature maps. Then the semantic feature of the perspective voxel is fused with the geometric feature of the point. A 3D object detection model (PVF-DectNet) is designed using PVFusion. During training we employ the ground truth paste (GT-Paste) data augmentation and solve the occlusion problem caused by newly added object. The KITTI validation set is used to validate the PVF-DectNet, which shows 3.6% AP improvement over the other feature fusion methods in pedestrian detection. On the KITTI test set, the PVF-DectNet outperforms the other multi-modal SOTA methods by 2.2% AP in pedestrian detection. And PVFusion shows better detection performance for sparse point clouds than PointFusion in both car and pedestrian categories. As for 32 beams LiDAR scene, there are 4.2% AP increment in moderate difficulty car category and 5.2% mAP improvement in pedestrian category.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0952-1976	1873-6769										Chongqing Univ, Coll Mech & Vehicle Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R ChinaChina Automot Engn Res Inst Co Ltd, Chongqing 401122, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China	China Automot Engn Res Inst Co Ltd			2023-03-12	WOS:000935148100001

The present investigation proposes a new approach to identify a set of non-dominated neural network models for further selection by the decision-maker. A new co -evolution approach is proposed to simultaneously select the features and topology of neural networks (collectively referred to as neural architecture), where the features are viewed from a topological perspective as input neurons. Further, the co-evolution is posed as a multi-criteria problem to evolve sparse and efficacious neural architectures. The well-known dominance and decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are augmented with a non-geometric crossover operator to diversify and balance the search for neural architectures across conflicting criteria. Moreover, the co-evolution is augmented to accommodate the data-based implications of distinct market behaviors prior to and during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A detailed comparative evaluation is carried out with the conventional sequential approach of feature selection followed by neural topology design, as well as a scalarized co-evolution approach. The results on three market indices (NASDAQ, NYSE, and S&P500) in pre-and peri-COVID time windows convincingly demonstrate that the proposed co-evolution approach can evolve a set of non-dominated neural forecasting models with better generalization capabilities.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0167-9236	1873-5797										Univ Cote Azur, SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, FranceUniv Auckland, Dept Elect Comp & Software Engn, Auckland, New Zealand				2023-11-24	WOS:001095713400001

We report the findings from two case studies aimed at assessing the multiplicity that can be observed when the same medical phenomenon is recorded by multiple competent experts, yet the recorded data enable the knowledgeable management of illness trajectories. Often framed in terms of the latent unreliability of medical data, and then treated as a problem to solve, we argue that practitioners in the health informatics field must gain a greater awareness of the natural variability of data inscribing work, assess it, and design solutions that allow actors on both sides of clinical data work, that is, the production and care, as well as the primary and secondary uses of data to aptly inform each other's practices.									19	0	0	0	1	0	21			1460-4582	1741-2811										IRCCS Ist Ortoped Galeazzi, Milan, ItalyUniv Milano Bicocca, Milan, ItalyIRCCS Fdn Don Carlo Gnocchi, Milan, ItalyUniv Carlo Cattaneo LIUC, Castellanza, Italy				2019-11-08	WOS:000492276100002	30666882

The geographic, factor endowment, cultural, and institutional distances were selected as variables from the aspects of geography, economy, culture, and politics to expand the gravity model. With this model, an empirical test was conducted using the data from China's export trade flows to Belt and Road countries from 2007 to 2016. The results showed that a Belt and Road country had greater trade flows from China when it had smaller geographic, factor endowment, and cultural distance and greater institutional distance from China. Based on the empirical results, we improved the comprehensive index method to measure the comprehensive distance indices between China and the Belt and Road countries. According to the comprehensive distance indices, these countries could be divided into four cooperation circles, in which the prioritized countries in the different phases were identified. Subsequently, the cooperation network construction was designed in four stages to gradually build an all-round, multi-level, and all-encompassing trade cooperation network between China and the Belt and Road countries. Eventually, based on the above consideration, policy suggestions are provided for the construction of such a network.									27	1	0	0	1	0	28				2071-1050										Ocean Univ China, Coll Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China				2018-07-06	WOS:000435587100135

Therefore, to help understand some of that scope it is essential to incorporate a range of perspectives, from a range of stakeholders, on current and emerging ethical challenges associated with computer technology. This study aims to achieve this by using, a three-pronged, stakeholder analysis of Computer Science academics, ICT industry professionals, and citizen groups was undertaken to explore what they consider to be crucial computing ethics concerns. The overlap between these stakeholder groups are explored, as well as whether their concerns are reflected in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach Data collection was performed using focus groups, and the data was analysed using a thematic analysis. The data was also analysed to determine if there were overlaps between the literature and the stakeholders' concerns and attitudes towards computing ethics. Findings The results of the focus group analysis show a mixture of overlapping concerns between the different groups, as well as some concerns that are unique to each of the specific groups. All groups stressed the importance of data as a key topic in computing ethics. This includes concerns around the accuracy, completeness and representativeness of data sets used to develop computing applications. Academics were concerned with the best ways to teach computing ethics to university students. Industry professionals believed that a lack of diversity in software teams resulted in important questions not being asked during design and development. Citizens discussed at length the negative and unexpected impacts of social media applications. These are all topics that have gained broad coverage in the literature. Social implications In recent years, the impact of ICT on society and the environment at large has grown tremendously. From this fast-paced growth, a myriad of ethical concerns have arisen. The analysis aims to shed light on what a diverse group of stakeholders consider the most important social impacts of technology and whether these concerns are reflected in the literature on computing ethics. The outcomes of this analysis will form the basis for new teaching content that will be developed in future to help illuminate and address these concerns. Originality/value The multi-stakeholder analysis provides individual and differing perspectives on the issues related to the rapidly evolving discipline of computing ethics.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-996X	1758-8871										Technol Univ Dublin, Sch Comp Sci, Appl Social Comp Network ASCNet Res Grp, Dublin City Ctr Campus, Dublin, IrelandTELECOM SudParis, Samovar Lab, Inst Polytech Paris, Evry, France	Technol Univ Dublin			2021-10-06	WOS:000700090100001

Three types of experiments were conducted: a chemostat, where the dilution rate was shifted up or down in stepwise manner; and a productostat, with either stepwise changed or a rampwise increased ethanol setpoint, i.e., an accelero-productostat. The transient responses from chemostat and productostat experiments were interpreted using a simple metabolic flux model. In a productostat it was possible to obtain oxido-reductive steady states at dilution rates far below D-crit due to a strong repression of the respiratory system. However, these steady states could not be obtained in a chemostat, since a dilution rate shift-down from an oxido-reductive steady state led to a derepression of the respiratory system. It can therefore be concluded that the range of dilution rates where steady-state multiplicity can be obtained differs depending on the operation mode and that this dilution rate multiplicity range may appear larger in a productostat than in a chemostat. A more narrow multiplicity range, however, was obtained when the productostat was operated as an accelero-productostat. @ 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									6	1	0	0	3	0	7			0006-3592	1097-0290										Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Chem Engn, CAPEC, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkTech Univ Denmark, Bioctr, Ctr Proc Biotechnol, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark				2004-12-30	WOS:000225557000004	15538722

This assessment is crucial for both students and educators, as it enables teachers to efficiently gauge student comprehension and helps students tailor their learning approaches to suit their individual needs, thereby fostering personalized growth. However, existing research on post-quality assessment faces challenges: 1) They overlook multimodal information interaction between post and topic, leading to inaccurate evaluations. 2) They are usually classification tasks that fail to provide feedback on the minor and relative differences between posts on the same topic. 3) They are usually evaluated using a single perspective, which is insufficient for capturing the complexity of the relationship between post and topic. Based on the above challenges, we propose a new assessment task, Multimodal Topic-Post Relevance Score Prediction (MTRSP), which analyzes whether a student's post comprehensively answers the question of the discussion topic by combining text and images to predict topic-post relevance scores, i.e., the degree of correctness of the answer. We develop an end-to-end Multi-perspective Topic-Post Relevance Score Reasoning (MTRSR) Method to solve the MTRSP Task, which leverages images and text from both the post and topic to infer topic-post relevance scores based on semantic similarity and logical coherence. Specifically, the topic-post content relevance reasoning module uses multimodal fusion to learn the semantic similarity of posts and topics. The logical coherence inference module examines the logical connections between posts and topics. Finally, we use three newly collected multimodal topic- post datasets and the public dataset Lazada-Home as an evaluation benchmark for the MTRSP task. Experimental results show that our MTRSR method can bring up to 9.02% in the NDCG@3 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) metric compared to the best-performing text-only model.

Multi-perspective modeling: managing heterogeneous manufacturing knowledge based on ontologies and topic maps								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH				51	11			3252	3269				10.1080/00207543.2012.756152							Article	JUN 1 2013	2013	Knowledge organisation is an important topic for knowledge management and application. However, in the current knowledge-intensive manufacturing environment, documents are heterogeneous and come from multi-disciplinary domains and product process phases, which make the knowledge behind documents difficult to represent and manage. This hinders knowledge sharing and reuse in manufacturing activities. In order to solve the problem, this paper presents a novel multi-perspective modelling approach for manufacturing knowledge representation and organisation. It combines the ideas of ontologies and topic maps together to give a unified representation of knowledge association semantically. This new modelling method takes advantage of both ontologies and topic maps: general knowledge in domains is described with ontology-based descriptions, and specific knowledge, such as extended or new knowledge entities and relations, is described with topic map-based descriptions. It supports various relation types in manufacturing knowledge and organises association in different facets at several levels. In addition, it can be used in association management, information retrieval, semantic inference and expansion, recommendation and navigation for knowledge sharing and reuse. A case study for representing electronic manufacturing knowledge is introduced to demonstrate the implementation of the proposed method, which shows that it is valid and practical.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0020-7543	1366-588X										Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R ChinaChina Informat Technol Secur Evaluat Ctr, Beijing 100085, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China	China Informat Technol Secur Evaluat Ctr			2013-07-24	WOS:000320692300006

In this regard, the main contribution is a symbolic/numeric application of the multiplicity-induced-dominancy property in the control of unmanned aerial vehicles rotorcrafts featuring time-delays. The multiplicity-induced-dominancy property is considered to address two of the most representative aerial robotic platforms: a classical quadrotor vehicle and a quadrotor vehicle endowed with tilting rotors. The aforementioned property leads to an effective delayed feedback control design (multiplicity-induced-dominancy tuning criteria), allowing the system to meet prescribed behavior conditions based on the placement of the rightmost root of the corresponding closed-loop characteristic function/quasipolynomial. Lastly, the results of detailed numerical simulations, including the linear and non-linear dynamics of the vehicle, are presented and discussed to validate the proposal.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1077-5463	1741-2986										Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS, Inria Lab Signaux & Syst L2S, Cent Superlec, Gif Sur Yvette, FranceInst Polytech Sci Avancees IPSA, 63 Blvd Brandebourg, F-94200 Ivry, FranceUniv Limoges, ENSIL ENSCI, CNRS, XLIM,UMR, Limoges, France	Inst Polytech Sci Avancees IPSA			2022-05-29	WOS:000799785000001

Generally, SC methods contain some parameters to be tuned, and different affinity matrices can obtain with different parameter values. In this paper, for the first time, we study a method for fusing these different affinity matrices to promote clustering performance and provide the corresponding solution from a multi-view clustering (MVC) perspective. That is, we argue that the different affinity matrices are consistent and complementary, which is similar to the fundamental assumption of MVC methods. Based on this observation, in this paper, we use least squares regression (LSR), which is a typical SC method, as an example since it can be efficiently optimized and has shown good clustering performance and we propose a novel robust least squares regression method from an MVC perspective (RLSR/MVCP). Specifically, we first utilize LSR with different parameter values to obtain different affinity matrices. Then, to fully explore the information contained in these different affinity matrices and to remove noise, we further fuse these affinity matrices into a tensor, which is constrained by the tensor low-rank constraint, i.e., the tensor nuclear norm (TNN). The two steps are combined into a framework that is solved by the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) method. The experimental results on several datasets indicate that RLSR/MVCP has very encouraging clustering performance and is superior to state-of-the-art SC methods.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1057-7149	1941-0042										Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China				2024-01-08	WOS:001126139200002	37906476

These discrepancy components originate from the deviation between the increasing business process operational state and the outdated original planning model. Considerable domain-specific knowledge is required to determine the threshold points for selecting appropriate activities, but process analysts rarely know each scenario's domain knowledge. Moreover, most analytical processes only focussed on the control flow level. Aiming at these issues, this paper proposes a Hybrid Behavioural and Resource Trusted intervals Updating algorithm (BI&RI Updating) for model enhancement based on control level and resource level of online event streams. First, analyse the reference model to construct multi-perspective trusted interval constraints in the offline stage. From a control-flow perspective, the behavioural relationships between activities are researched using a deep clustering approach. Moreover, from a data-flow standpoint, resource co-occurrence relationships are analysed based on association rules. Next, the incremental update algorithm in online scenarios is proposed to update the model by filtering the event streams and iteratively optimising the trusted intervals. Finally, the proposed algorithm is implemented based on the PM4PY framework and evaluated using real logs with both outcome model quality and execution efficiency. The results show that the algorithm can execute quickly and improve the quality of the model even in a non-ideal state where the logs contain noise.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0954-0091	1360-0494										Anhui Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Math & Big Data, Huainan, Peoples R ChinaAnhui Prov Engn Lab Big Data Anal & Early Warning, Huainan 232001, Peoples R China	Anhui Prov Engn Lab Big Data Anal & Early Warning			2022-06-29	WOS:000814060900001

Some of them, such as trace clustering, trace classification, and anomalous trace detection require a preliminary preprocessing step in which the raw data is encoded into a numerical feature space. To this end, encoding techniques are used to generate vectorial representations of process traces. Most of the PM literature provides trace encoding techniques that look at the control flow, that is, only encode the sequence of activities that characterize a process trace disregarding other process data that is fundamental for effectively describing the process behavior. To fill this gap, in this article we show 19 trace encoding methods that work in a multi-perspective manner, that is, by embedding events and trace attributes in addition to activity names into the vectorial representations of process traces. We also provide an extensive experimental study where these techniques are applied to real-life datasets and compared to each other.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1942-4787	1942-4795										CNR, CNR, Inst High Performance Comp & Networking, ICAR, Arcavacata Di Rende, ItalyBoise State Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Boise, ID USA				2025-01-11	WOS:001391194900001

The data were primarily collected through 43 semi-structured interviews with managers of focal companies and their multi-tier suppliers.Findings The authors found that in order to facilitate their supply chains to learn sustainability, MNCs tend to orchestrate in breadth by internally setting up new functional departments and externally working with third parties, and orchestrate in depth working directly with their extreme upstream suppliers adopting varied governance mechanisms on lower-tier suppliers along the project lifecycle. The resource orchestration in breadth and depth and along the project lifecycle results in changes of supply chain structure.Practical implications The proposed conceptual model provides an overall framework for companies to design and implement their multi-tier sustainable initiatives. Companies could learn from the suggested learning stages and the best practices of case companies.Originality/value The authors extend and enrich resource orchestration perspective (ROP), which is internally focused, to a supply chain level, and answer a theoretical question of how MNCs orchestrate their internal and external resources to help their supply chains to learn sustainability. The extension of ROP refutes the resource dependence theory, which adopts a passive approach of relying on external suppliers and proposes that MNCs should proactively work with internal and external stakeholders to learn sustainability.									211	0	0	1	1	1	217			0144-3577	1758-6593										Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, Southampton, Hants, EnglandUniv Bristol, Sch Econ Finance & Management, Dept Management, Bristol, Avon, EnglandUniv Sheffield, Sch Management, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England				2018-04-05	WOS:000428074300007

We develop a general model to represent infrastructures that allows for a unique decomposition into 'elementary infrastructure components' based on heterogeneous user requirements. Notably, it incorporates a cost function with a very generic and adaptable structure, for which we can still explicitly determine the costs of each individual component. As a direct consequence an intuitive cost allocation rule is obtained: equal component cost sharing. This allocation rule is in line with existing game -theoretic concepts and satisfies the desirable properties of advantageous scaling and coalitional rationality. Advantageous scaling guarantees that the costs allocated to each existing user do not increase if the number of users grows larger and coalitional rationality ensures that there is no subgroup of infrastructure users that would have a financial reason to object to the cost allocation. Additionally, we examine the application of our model to a prospective CO2 transport infrastructure for CCUS in the port of Rotterdam and the adjoining industry area.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0959-6526	1879-1786										Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, Ctr, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, NetherlandsStrateg Business Anal, TNO, POB 96800, NL-2509 JE JE Den Haag, NetherlandsTIAS Sch Business & Soc, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, NetherlandsEindhoven Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Innovat Sci, POB 513, Eindhoven 5600 MB, Netherlands				2024-06-11	WOS:001154585500001

There exists an implementation which is highly optimised for a large number of final state particles. However, in fixed-order perturbative calculations with a small number of final state particles, it turns out that the computer time needed for the jet clustering of this implementation is comparable to the computer time of the matrix elements. This article reports on an implementation of the SISCone algorithm optimised for low particle multiplicities.Program summaryProgram title: siscone_partonCatalogue identifier: AELF_v1_0Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AELF_v1_0.htmlProgram obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N.

Here, we introduce a general and efficient IPAP strategy to achieve S3 editing simultaneously for all multiplicities in the acquisition dimension of the HSQC experiment. Complementary in-phase (HSQC-IP) and anti-phase (HSQC-AP) data are separately recorded with a simple phase exchange of two 90 degrees proton Pulses involved in the mixing process of the F2-coupled sensitivity-improved HSQC pulse sequence. Additive and subtractive linear combination of these IP/AP data generates simplified F2-alpha/beta-spin-edited HSQC subspectra for all IS, I2S, and I3S spin systems and combines enhanced and optimized sensitivity with excellent tolerance to unwanted cross-talk contributions over a considerable range of coupling constants. Practical aspects such as pulse phase settings, transfer efficiency dependence, inter-pulse delay optimization, and percentage of cross-talk are theoretically analyzed and discussed as a function of each InS multiplicity. Particular emphasis on the features associated to spin-editing in diastereotopic I2S Spin systems and application to the measurement of long-range proton-carbon coupling constants are also provided.

Different numbers of covariates, sample sizes, effect sizes of covariates, and correlations among covariates were explored. The false positive rate (FPR) and power were evaluated.ResultsThe FPR for the FCM approach dramatically increases with number of covariates. The chance of incorrectly selecting 1 seemingly clinically relevant covariates can be increased from 5% to a 40-70% range for 10-20 covariates. The SCI approach may provide appropriate control of the family-wise FPR, allowing more appropriate decision making. As a result, the power detecting real effects without incorrectly identifying non-existing effects can be greatly improved by the SCI approach compared to the approach in current practice. The performance of the SCI approach is driven by the ratio of sample size to number of covariates. The FPR can be controlled at 5% and 10% using the SCI approach when the ratio was 20 and 10, respectively.ConclusionThe FCM approach still lies within the framework of statistical testing, and therefore multiplicity is an issue for this approach. It is imperative to consider multiplicity reporting and adjustments in FCM modelling practice to ensure more appropriate decision making.									29	0	0	0	17	0	31			0306-5251	1365-2125										Janssen Res & Dev, 920 Route 202, Raritan, NJ 08869 USAAnhui Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth Adm, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaUS FDA, Div Clin Pharmacol, Off Clin Pharmacol, Silver Spring, MD USAUniv Sci & Technol China, Dept Stat & Finance, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R ChinaAthenex Inc, Conventus 1001Main St, Buffalo, NY 14203 USAUniv Hong Kong, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Athenex Inc			2018-07-01	WOS:000435440600015	29522646

The supply chain sustainability greatly influenced by its freight transport activities. Most of the previous work discussed the economic and environmental sustainability of freight transport industry; although the social sustainability (SS) dimension paid less attention to researchers and practitioners of emerging economies. The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of SS indicators in the freight transport industry. The SS assessment framework is validated with the Indian freight transport industry. Design/methodology/approach The proposed framework considers four SS dimension and 25 indicators. The SS indicators' importance varies with the individual company's prospect. Therefore the proposed framework is used in multi-company perspective as well as in industry perspective to present more realistic results. The importance weight of SS dimension and indicators are computed with a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method, i.e. fuzzy best-worst method (FBWM). Findings The prioritisation of SS indicators in each company perspective is compared with an industry perspective. The contribution to community health and education program is most valuable indicator followed by the prevention of child and forced labour. The model robustness is tested through sensitivity analysis and reported that less variation in indicators' ranking. Originality/value To authors best of knowledge, this is the first study to highlight the importance of SS indicators in the freight transport industry. This study contributes to the sustainability assessment literature by providing a nuanced perception of the SS indicators and put forward managerial implications for improving the SS of the freight transport industry. The proposed framework could be treated as a benchmark for other developing nation's freight transport industry.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			1741-0398	1758-7409										IIT Roorkee, Dept Management Studies, Roorkee, Uttar Pradesh, India				2020-04-20	WOS:000524470900001

Environment programming accounts for conceiving the computational environment where agents are situated as a first-class abstraction for programming MAS, namely a part of the system that can be designed and programmed-aside to agents-to encapsulate functionalities that will be exploited by agents at runtime. From a programming and software engineering perspective, this is meant to improve the modularity, extensibility and reusability of the MAS as a software system. By adopting the A&A meta-model, we consider environments populated by a dynamic set of computational entities called artifacts, collected in workspaces. From the agent viewpoint, artifacts are first-class entities of their environment, representing resources and tools that they can dynamically instantiate, share and use to support individual and collective activities. From the MAS programmer viewpoint, artifacts are a first-class abstraction to shape and program functional environments that agents will exploit at runtime, including functionalities that concern agent interaction, coordination, organisation, and the interaction with the external environment. The article includes a description of the main concepts concerning artifact-based environments and related CArtAgO technology, as well as an overview of their application in MAS programming.									101	1	0	0	1	0	107			1387-2532	1573-7454										Univ Bologna, DEIS, Cesena, Italy				2011-05-09	WOS:000289797300002

Traditional methods mainly focus on the heterogeneity of regional resources and environment rather than residents' behavioral activities. However, residents' behavioral activities are one of the most important factors influencing urban spatial form. Fortunately, the emergence of big data, especially phone signaling data, provides alternative data sources to understand the dynamic resident behavior activity space, which is significant for people-oriented urban development. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for UGB delineation based on multi-source big data and multi-objective constraints, which emphasizes humanism and the low-carbon concept in urban expansion simulation. The multi-objective constraints are constructed from the evaluation of resident activity space expansion potential, the evaluation of urban construction suitability, the evaluation of ecological conservation importance, and the human survival materials limitation. We apply the framework to Ningbo, and the results show that the framework under multi-objective constraints from a people-oriented and low-carbon perspective is more reliable and comprehensive than that without constraints. The findings also show that the UGB delineation based on multi-source big data has higher accuracy and better performance. The conceptual and methodological advances of this study are also applicable to other cities to help UGBs delineation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2071-1050										Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Resources & Environm Engn, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R ChinaCNIPA, Patent Examinat Cooperat Guangdong Ctr, Patent Off, Guangzhou 510000, Peoples R China	CNIPA			2022-12-25	WOS:000896341600001

In most real-world scenarios, stance detection needs to work in a zero-shot manner, i.e., predicting stances for unseen targets without labeled data. One critical challenge of zero-shot stance detection is the absence of contextual information on the targets. Current works mostly concentrate on introducing external knowledge to supplement information about targets, but the noisy schema-linking process hinders their performance in practice. To combat this issue, we argue that previous studies have ignored the extensive target -related information inhabited in the unlabeled data during the training phase, and propose a simple yet efficient Multi-Perspective Contrastive Learning Framework for zero-shot stance detection. Our framework is capable of leveraging information not only from labeled data but also from extensive unlabeled data. To this end, we design target-oriented contrastive learning and label-oriented contrastive learning to capture more comprehensive target representation and more distinguishable stance features. We conduct extensive experiments on three widely adopted datasets (from 4870 to 33,090 instances), namely SemEval-2016, WT-WT, and VAST. Our framework achieves 53.6%, 77.1%, and 72.4% macro-average F1 scores on these three datasets, showing 2.71% and 0.25% improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on the SemEval-2016 and WT-WT datasets and comparable results on the more challenging VAST dataset.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0306-4573	1873-5371										Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Data Intelligence Syst Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Comp Technol, Key Lab Network Data Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China				2023-05-04	WOS:000971595100001

At times M >= 1 dose levels or BMRs are of interest, and some form of multiplicity adjustment is necessary to ensure a valid 100(1 - a)% simultaneous inference. Bonferroni correction is often employed in practice for such purposes. Though relative simple to implement, the Bonferroni strategy can suffer from extreme conservatism (Nitcheva et al., 2005; Al-Saidy et al., 2003). Recently, Kerns (2017) proposed the use of simultaneous hyperbolic and three-segment bands to perform multiple inferences in risk assessment under Abbott-adjusted log-logistic model with the dose level constrained to a given interval. In this paper, we present and compare methods for deriving multiplicity-adjusted upper limits on extra risk and lower bounds on the benchmark dose under Abbott-adjusted log-logistic model.

The number of unit jobs in a set is called the multiplicity of that set. The problem was formulated in Hochbaum et al. as an integer quadratic nonseparable transportation problem and solved, in polynomial time, independent of the size of the multiplicities and the due dates but depending on the penalty weights. In this paper we show how to solve the above problem in polynomial time which is independent of the sizes of the weights. The running time of the algorithm depends on the dimension of the problem and only the size of the maximal difference between two consecutive due dates. In the case where the due dates are large, but the size of the maximal difference between two consecutive due dates is polynomially bounded by the dimension of the problem, the algorithm runs in strongly polynomial time.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0166-218X											SUNY STONY BROOK,WA HARRIMAN SCH MANAGEMENT & POLICY,STONY BROOK,NY 11794				1993-01-26	WOS:A1993KH77100004

A simple graph has been associated with the set of symmetric matrices having a zero-nonzero pattern of off-diagonal entries described by the graph, and the minimum rank/maximum eigenvalue multiplicity among matrices in this set is readily computable for a tree. In this paper, we extend techniques for trees to tree sign patterns and trees allowing loops (with the presence or absence of loops describing the zero-nonzero pattern of the diagonal), allowing precise computation of the minimum rank of a tree sign pattern and a tree allowing loops. For a symmetric tree sign pattern or a tree that allows loops, we provide an algorithm that allows exact computation of maximum multiplicity and minimum rank, and can be used to obtain a symmetric integer matrix realizing minimum rank.

The diversity of species coupled with the inherent contextual ambiguity of natural language poses a primary challenge in the cross-modal representation alignment of conservation area image data. Integrating cross-modal retrieval tasks with generation tasks contributes to cross-modal representation alignment based on contextual understanding. However, during the contrastive learning process, apart from learning the differences in the data itself, a pair of encoders inevitably learns the differences caused by encoder fluctuations. The latter leads to convergence shortcuts, resulting in poor representation quality and an inaccurate reflection of the similarity relationships between samples in the original dataset within the shared space of features. To achieve fine-grained cross-modal representation alignment, we first propose a residual attention network to enhance consistency during momentum updates in cross-modal encoders. Building upon this, we propose momentum encoding from a multi-task perspective as a bridge for cross-modal information, effectively improving cross-modal mutual information, representation quality, and optimizing the distribution of feature points within the cross-modal shared semantic space. By acquiring momentum encoding queues for cross-modal semantic understanding through multi-tasking, we align ambiguous natural language representations around the invariant image features of factual information, alleviating contextual ambiguity and enhancing model robustness. Experimental validation shows that our proposed multi-task perspective of cross-modal momentum encoders outperforms similar models on standardized image classification tasks and image-text cross-modal retrieval tasks on public datasets by up to 8% on the leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Qualitative experiments on our self-built conservation area image-text paired dataset show that our proposed method accurately performs cross-modal retrieval and generation tasks among 8142 species, proving its effectiveness on fine-grained cross-modal image-text conservation area image datasets.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1424-8220										Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Comp & Control Engn, Harbin 150040, Peoples R ChinaHulunbuir Univ, Coll Artificial Intelligence & Big Data, Hulunbuir 021008, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Harbin 150076, Peoples R ChinaHeilongjiang Forestry Intelligent Equipment Engn R, Harbin 150040, Peoples R China	Heilongjiang Forestry Intelligent Equipment Engn R			2024-05-31	WOS:001231316400001	38793984

In the recent past, data augmentation has been employed in contrastive learning based knowledge distillation techniques yielding superior results. Despite the significant role of data augmentation, its value remains underappreciated within the domain of knowledge distillation, with no in-depth analysis in the literature thus far. To make up for this oversight, we conduct a multi -perspective theoretical and experimental analysis on the role that data augmentation can play in knowledge distillation. We summarize the properties of data augmentation and list the core findings as follows. (a) Our investigations validate that data augmentation significantly boosts the performance of knowledge distillation on the tasks of image classification and object detection. And this holds true even if the teacher model lacks comprehensive information about the augmented samples. Moreover, our novel J oint D ata A ugmentation (JDA) approach outperforms single data augmentation in knowledge distillation. (b) The pivotal role of data augmentation in knowledge distillation can be theoretically explained via Sharpness -Aware Minimization. (c) The compatibility of data augmentation with various knowledge distillation methods can enhance their performance. In light of these observations, we propose a new method called C osine C onfidence D istillation (CCD) for more reasonable knowledge transfer from augmented samples. Experimental results not only demonstrate that CCD becomes the state-of-the-art method with less storage requirement on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, but also validate the superiority of CCD over DIST on the object detection benchmark dataset, MS-COCO.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0925-2312	1872-8286										Southeast Univ, Sch Instrument Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2024-05-22	WOS:001220633700001

In general, it is quite a challenge to establish conditions on the parameters of the system in order to guarantee such a stability. Recent works emphasized the link between maximal multiplicity and dominant roots. Indeed, conditions for a given multiple root to be necessarily dominant are investigated, this property is known as Multiplicity-Induced-Dominancy (MID). The aim of this paper is to explore the effect of multiple roots with admissible multiplicities exhibiting, under appropriate conditions, the validity of the MID property for second-order neutral time-delay differential equations with a single delay. The ensu-ing control methodology is summarized in a five-steps algorithm that can be exploited in the design of higher-order systems. The main ingredient of the proposed method is the dominancy proof for multi-ple spectral values based on frequency bounds established via integral equations. As an illustration, the stabilization of the classical oscillator benefits from the obtained results. (c) 2022 European Control Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, such elaborate methods differ a lot from the unsophisticated way biological entities are supposed to communicate. Yet, it has been recently shown by Feinerman et al. (PODC 2014) that complex coordination tasks such as rumor spreading and majority consensus can plausibly be achieved in biological systems subject to noisy communication channels, where every message transferred through a channel remains intact with small probability 1/2 + epsilon, without using coding techniques. This result is a considerable step towards a better understanding of the way biological entities may cooperate. It has nevertheless been established only in the case of 2-valued opinions: rumor spreading aims at broadcasting a single-bit opinion to all nodes, and majority consensus aims at leading all nodes to adopt the single-bit opinion that was initially present in the system with (relative) majority. In this paper, we extend this previous work to k-valued opinions, for any constant k >= 2. Our extension requires to address a series of important issues, some conceptual, others technical. We had to entirely revisit the notion of noise, for handling channels carrying k-valued messages. In fact, we precisely characterize the type of noise patterns for which plurality consensus is solvable. Also, a key result employed in the bivalued case by Feinerman et al. is an estimate of the probability of observing the most frequent opinion from observing the mode of a small sample. We generalize this result to the multivalued case by providing a new analytical proof for the bivalued case that is amenable to be extended, by induction, and that is of independent interest.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0178-2770	1432-0452										CNRS, Inst Rech Informat Fondamentale, Paris, FranceUniv Paris Diderot, Paris, FranceMax Planck Inst Informat, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany				2019-08-02	WOS:000475627800001

Multiplicity-calibrated Bayesian hypothesis tests								BIOSTATISTICS				11	3			473	483				10.1093/biostatistics/kxq012							Article	JUL 2010	2010	When testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously, there is a need to adjust the levels of the individual tests to effect control of the family-wise error rate (FWER). Standard frequentist adjustments control the error rate but are typically both conservative and oblivious to prior information. We propose a Bayesian testing approach-multiplicity-calibrated Bayesian hypothesis testing-that sets individual critical values to reflect prior information while controlling the FWER via the Bonferroni inequality. If the prior information is specified correctly, in the sense that those null hypotheses considered most likely to be false in fact are false, the power of our method is substantially greater than that of standard frequentist approaches. We illustrate our method using data from a pharmacogenetic trial and a preclinical cancer study. We demonstrate its error rate control and power advantage by simulation.									15	0	0	0	5	0	16			1465-4644	1468-4357										Dana Farber Canc Inst, Dept Biostat & Computat Biol, Boston, MA 02446 USAUniv Penn, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA				2010-07-01	WOS:000278689300016	20212321

Theoretical investigation is very important for designing high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials. In the present work, an unusual Li@B10H14 dimer with different spin multiplicities was designed theoretically to explore the influence of the spin multiplicity on NLO properties: 1 (triplet), 2 (open shell singlet) and 3 (singlet). Interestingly, the results show that the intersection angle (between cage A and cage A') follows the order of 1 (13.71 degrees)>2 (1.65 degrees)>3 (0 degrees). As a result, the first hyperpolarizability (beta(tot)) value follows the order of 1 (19,129 a.u.)<2 (35,992 a.u.)<3 (77,660 a.u.). Additionally, 1, 2 and 3 of lambda(max) shows an apparent red shift with three spin multiplicities in the absorption spectrum. The results of this work can be expected to provide useful information for designing high-performance NLO materials based on decaborane.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1610-2940	0948-5023										NE Normal Univ, Inst Funct Mat Chem, Fac Chem, Changchun 130024, Jilin, Peoples R China				2014-10-08	WOS:000341865300018	25213111

Previous methods have attempted to utilize collaborative information from adjacent sessions or item attribute knowledge as supplements. However, these methods are prone to introducing interfering information through their session similarity measurement strategies and attribute embedding learning processes, both requiring optimization. Moreover, they often fail to fully model global item relationships. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Multi -perspective Learning for Enhanced User Preferences (MLEUP) for session -based recommendations. Specifically, we first construct reliable session groups by measuring the overlap and incompatibility of items across sessions to calculate session similarity. Then, by modeling attribute-item and attribute-attribute relationships, along with employing a neighbor -based contrastive self -supervised attribute learning task, we learn high -quality attribute embeddings that capture the user's stable preferences. Next, leveraging the session groups, we model global item multigranularity co -occurrence and high -order sequential relationships through designed attention layers, enabling us to learn informative item embeddings that represent the user's dynamic preferences. Finally, we further model the correlated relationship between the two user preference representations. Our approach ensures that effective attribute knowledge and global collaborative information are learned to mitigate the data sparsity issue, while comprehensively modeling global item relationships to capture the user's complex dynamic preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that MLEUP achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision, MRR, and NDCG.

To automatically and accurately characterize the glaze icing state of suspension insulators susceptible to icicle bridging, this paper proposes a novel method for calculating icicle morphological parameters, including icicle distribution and bridging degree, using images from multi-perspective monitoring scenarios. The method first recognizes and segments images to focus on insulators, then uses gradient-contour analysis to correct axial tilt, locate shed units of different materials, and detect icicles between sheds. It utilizes the relative positions of shed units and icicles to quantify uneven and segmented icing phenomena and calculate the icicle bridging degree of the insulator string and shed units. Image analysis of 15 multi-view, multi-material, and varying-length suspension insulators demonstrates that this method achieves 98.8% precision in localizing 91 shed units and 94.6% precision in detecting 490 icicles. The accuracy in recognizing axial and circumferential icicle distributions is 91.2% and 98.9%, respectively, with precision surpassing 90% in calculating the icicle bridging degree. The method can finely parameterize icicles' position and length, providing a solution for image-based diagnosis of distribution uniformity and bridging severity of glaze ice on insulators.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8977	1937-4208										South China Univ Technol, Sch Elect Power Engn, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R ChinaChina Southern Power Grid Co Ltd, Elect Power Res Inst, Guangzhou 510663, Peoples R ChinaChina Southern Power Grid Co Ltd, Guizhou Elect Sci Inst, Guiyang 550000, Guizhou, Peoples R China				2025-04-06	WOS:001454002300042

Solving the problem has a profound impact on driving the innovation and development of machine learning techniques and addressing complex problems in the real world. In recent years, researchers have begun to focus on utilizing quantum computing to solve the multi-category classification problem. Some studies have shown that the process of processing information in the brain may be related to quantum phenomena, with different brain regions having neurons with different structures. Inspired by this, we design a quantum multi-category classifier model from this perspective for the first time. The model employs a heterogeneous population of quantum neural networks (QNNs) to simulate the cooperative work of multiple different brain regions. When processing information, these heterogeneous clusters of QNNs allow for simultaneous execution on different quantum computers, thus simulating the brain's ability to utilize multiple brain regions working in concert to maintain the robustness of the model. By setting the number of heterogeneous QNN clusters and parameterizing the number of stacks of unit layers in the quantum circuit, the model demonstrates excellent scalability in dealing with different types of data and different numbers of classes in the classification problem. Based on the attention mechanism of the brain, we integrate the processing results of heterogeneous QNN clusters to achieve high accuracy in classification. Finally, we conducted classification simulation experiments on different datasets. The results show that our method exhibits strong robustness and scalability. Among them, on different subsets of the MNIST dataset, its classification accuracy improves by up to about 5% compared to other quantum multiclassification algorithms. This result becomes the state-of-the-art simulation result for quantum classification models and exceeds the performance of classical classifiers with a considerable number of trainable parameters on some subsets of the MNIST dataset.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2632-2153										Lab Adv Comp & Intelligence Engn, Zhengzhou, Peoples R China	Lab Adv Comp & Intelligence Engn			2024-09-15	WOS:001306572000001

For a three-candidate election, we characterize when an AV election can violate monotonicity. We use this characterization to show that the compound procedure is no more likely (and for certain numbers of voters, strictly less likely) to produce an election that can violate monotonicity. We also show that the voting profiles that can violate monotonicity in an AV election are disjoint from those that can violate monotonicity in an election using the compound procedure. Finally, we find sharp lower bounds for the number of voters required for AV and the compound procedure to yield an election that can violate monotonicity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0272-4960	1464-3634										Sacred Heart Univ, 5151 Pk Ave, Fairfield, CT 06825 USASt Anselm Coll, 100 St Anselm Dr, Manchester, NH 03102 USA	St Anselm Coll			2018-08-02	WOS:000439708000008

The traditional recommendation methods have relatively low accuracy because they lack considering information from the perspective of user relationship strength into the recommendation algorithm. User relationship strength reflects the degree of closeness between two users, which can make the recommendation system more efficient between users in pairs. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional comprehensive recommendation method based on user relationship strength. We take three main factors into consideration, including the strength of user relationship, the similarity of entities, and the degree of user interest. First, we introduce a novel method to generate a user candidate set and an entity candidate set by calculating the relationship strength between two users and the similarity between two entities. Then, the algorithm will calculate the user interest degree of each user in the user candidate set to each entity in the entity candidate set, if the user interest degree is larger than or equal to a threshold, this particular entity will be recommended to this user. The performance of the proposed method was verified based on the real-world social network dataset and the e-commerce website dataset, and the experimental result suggests that this method can improve the recommendation accuracy.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1335-9150											Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Informat Mech & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Normal Univ, Inst Artificial Intelligence Educ, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China				2020-08-06	WOS:000551861500006		
J	Dou, Yudan; Zhu, Shuhang; Yan, Xueya; Li, Tianxin					Zhu, Shuhang/0009-0005-7404-9637					Coupled Paths of Influencing Factors on The Diffusion of Prefabricated Construction Technology: A Multi-agent Synergy Perspective								KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				28	8			3074	3090				10.1007/s12205-024-1912-8					MAY 2024		Article	AUG 2024	2024	Prefabricated construction (PC) technology diffusion, as a key to promoting PC, has attracted increasing attention from academia and industry in recent years. The diffusion of PC technology mainly stems from the coupling effect of multiple influencing factors, especially the multi-agent synergy. This study is to explore the multi-dimensional influencing factors and their coupling paths for the diffusion of PC technology, from a multi-agent synergy perspective. First, six critical factors identified through literature review are divided into three dimensions. Further, fourteen theoretical hypotheses are proposed for the interactions of these factors and their impacts on the diffusion of PC technology, highlighting the role of multi-agent synergy. Then, an empirical research method based on partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and questionnaire survey data were used to reveal the relationship between the influencing factors and the coupling path of PC technology diffusion. The findings suggest that organization strength (with the highest influence) and technology cooperation have positive effects, while technology investment has a negative effect, on PC technology diffusion. Both market competition and industry development play indirect roles on PC technology diffusion via technology investment, without direct effects. Government intervention positively moderates the path from technology investment and organizational strength to PC technology diffusion, respectively, with the strongest moderating effect between government intervention and organization strength. This study contributes to scientifically planning the diffusion of PC technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1226-7988	1976-3808										Dalian Univ Technol, Dept Construct Management, Dalian 116024, Peoples R China				2024-06-08	WOS:001237793200002

As the largest CO2 emitter and the biggest developing country in the world, China has pledged to cut its national carbon emission intensity (NCEI). The objective of this study is to develop a multi-perspective factorial hypothetical simulation model to facilitate the policy development for robust NCEI reduction. Based on multi-regional input-output model and hypothetical extraction method, the individual- and the system-based effects of 900 sectors on NCEI are investigated. Then, targeted countermeasures against key sectors are developed. After that, the effects and the complex interactions of the countermeasures on the system robustness and the system sustainability are examined by factorial analysis. The results reveal that it is feasible to cut NCEI of China through the proper adjustments of a few sectors, while some of them may at the cost of the system health. For example, controlling the production-based CO2 emission of Electricity and hot water production and supply in Shandong and shrinking the production scale of Metallurgy in Hebei could efficiently cut China's NCEI. However, the two countermeasures would deteriorate the system health through their main effects and interaction. These findings can provide new information for achieving China's NCEI goal.

Mass production requires the full working space of the machine to be used, although this arrangement could lead to location-related differences in part quality. The present work proposes the application of a multi-state machine performance perspective to reduce the achievable tolerance intervals of features of linear size in material extrusion (MEX) processes. Considering aspecific dimensional parameter, the dispersion and location of the distribution of measured values between different states are analyzed to determine whether the production should be treated as single-state or multi-state. A design for additive manufacturing strategy then applies global or local size compensations to modify the 3D design file and reduce deviations between manufactured values and theoretical values. The variation in the achievable tolerance range before and after the optimization of design is evaluated by establishing a target machine performance index. This strategy has been applied to an external MEX-manufactured cylindrical surface in a case study. The results show that the multi-state perspective provides a better understanding of the sources of quality variability and allows for a significant reduction in the achievable tolerance interval. The proposed strategy could help to accelerate the industrial adoption of AM process by reducing differences in quality with respect to conventional processes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2076-3417										Univ Oviedo, IPFRes ARAMO Grp, Gijon 33203, Spain				2021-07-05	WOS:000666145200001

After the feature elimination, the ensemble learning model (ELM) was trained to obtain a high-precision model for predicting life cycle carbon emissions (LCCE), life cycle costs (LCC), and indoor discomfort hours (IDH). Then, the optimal optimization algorithm was selected among three different optimization algorithms. Finally, the best building scheme was chosen according to the newly proposed solution. The results showed that the ELM could achieve high prediction efficiency by combining input feature evaluation and screening, multi-sampling methods, and hyperparameter optimization. The R2 value of ELM can reach 0.980, while the Two-Archive Evolutionary Algorithm for Constrained multi-objective optimi-zation (C-TAEA) was the optimal optimization algorithm. The best equilibrium solution proposed in this study solved the problem of different optimization ranges of different objectives and maximized the optimization value. Finally, the best equilibrium scheme reduced the LCCE by 34.7%, the LCC by 13.9%, and the IDH by 26.6%. Therefore, this strategy can efficiently optimize building objectives and produce a more balanced and optimal building scheme, thus making it widely applicable in building performance optimization.									48	2	0	0	0	0	50			0360-5442	1873-6785										Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Architecture, Tainan, TaiwanFuzhou Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Fuzhou, Peoples R China				2022-10-08	WOS:000861206700002

In order to develop a guideline-based decision support system (DSS) prototype to help clinicians deal with diabetic patients' foot problems, we drew on methodologies from qualitative research, cognitive science, and information systems. This multi-perspective approach was intended to facilitate user-centered design and evaluation.Methods: We employed field observations, structured interviews, and document analyses to collect and analyze users' workflow patterns, decision support goals, and preferences regarding interactions with a DSS. Next, we aligned their requirements with sequence diagrams and followed Nielsen's heuristics to develop a DSS prototype. We then performed think-aloud analyses and used the technology acceptance model to direct our evaluation of users' perceptions of the prototype.Results: Users had a positive response to the DSS prototype in terms of its clarity of design and ease of use. They expressed a high intention of using the system in the future.Conclusion: Applying multi-perspective methodologies is an effective way to study and design user interactions with the front end of a guideline-based DSS.

The small and sparse discriminative regions obtained froman image classification network that are typically used as the important initial location of semantic segmentation also form the bottleneck. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have exhibited promising performances for single-label image classification tasks, images of the real-world usually contain multiple categories, which is still an open problem. So, the problem of obtaining high-confidence discriminative regions from multi-label classification networks remains unsolved. To solve this problem, this article proposes an innovative three-step framework within the perspective of multi-object proposal generation. First, an image is divided into candidate boxes using the object proposal method. The candidate boxes are sent to a single-classification network to obtain the discriminative regions. Second, the discriminative regions are aggregated to obtain a high-confidence seed map. Third, the seed cues grow on the feature maps of high-level semantics produced by a backbone segmentation network. Experiments are carried out on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset to verify the effectiveness of our approach, which is shown to outperform other baseline image segmentation methods.									61	2	0	0	11	0	62			1551-6857	1551-6865										Shanghai Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Sci, ShangDa St 99, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Univ, Informat Off, ShangDa St 99, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China				2021-04-01	WOS:000646396900015

To address the challenges posed by the high complexity and strong concealment of APT attacks, provenance graph based on inter entity dependencies are used for forensic investigation. However, under long-term persistent attacks, entities with semantically consistent behavior patterns become excessively redundant, leading to an explosion of inter entity dependencies and a decrease in forensic efficiency. In addition, the implicit relationships within and between events are not fully represented, and alarm information spreads to neighboring benign events, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct attack scenario. In this paper, we propose an APT attack attribution method MPCA that combines multi-perspective confidence and association. Firstly, by merging parallel branches with semantically consistent behavior patterns in the process connected subgraph, redundant entities and their dependencies are reduced. Secondly, event confidence is estimated to exclude benign events, the association between events and alarms is analyzed to highlight attack events. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCA achieves state-of-the-art performance. MPCA can improve the efficiency of constructing attack scenario graphs, reduce false positive and false negative rates, and demonstrate greater adaptability in attack attribution tasks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0950-5849	1873-6025										Beijing Inst Technol, Informat Syst & Secur & Countermeasures Expt Ctr, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaHangzhou Zhiyuan Res Inst, Hangzhou 310020, Peoples R China	Hangzhou Zhiyuan Res Inst			2025-03-06	WOS:001433667200001

Earlier studies have adopted a two-step framework comprising representation learning followed by pattern mining. However, the reliance on clustering algorithms in the mining step introduces hypersensitivity to parameter selection, resulting in either redundant or missing visual patterns. Furthermore, the optimization based on two non-interactive steps prevents the framework from adapting itself to diverse data. In this work, we rethink the multi-pattern mining task from the perspective of prototype learning, and introduce an end-to-end Visual Pattern Prototypes Proposing (VP3) method with two losses: class-wise and pattern-wise contrastive loss. VP3 eliminates the reliance on clustering algorithms by treating prototypes as visual patterns, and integrates the mining results (pattern prototypes) into representation learning. Consequently, VP3 can achieve more robust results. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness and superior performance of VP3 over six state-of-the-art methods.

This paper reports on preliminary findings of a multi-method PhD study which examines the digital literacy practices arising when an adult learner in a UK college completes writing assignments for her course. It explores whether she uses digital tools agentively and decisively in her personal life, in order to transform her classroom practice. Data show that mobilising personal digital literacy practices into classroom-based literacy events allows learners to successfully make the link between their own everyday digital literacy practices and the requirements of their course. It is argued that a "social practice" approach to digital literacies, along with actor-network theory sensibilities, allows researchers to observe the sensitivity of classroom-based digital literacy events to the layered multiplicity of their contexts									15	0	0	0	0	0	20			0952-3987	1469-5790										Univ Leeds, Sch Educ, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England				2012-12-01	WOS:000210644100004

J	Wang, Ruiying; Jiang, Yong										Effective enhancement and fusion of multi-perspective features for self-supervised real image denoising								VISUAL COMPUTER													10.1007/s00371-025-04009-1					JUN 2025		Article; Early Access		2025	In real-world self-supervised denoising tasks, understanding the noise distribution and its spatial correlation is crucial. Most of the existing methods employ pixel-shuffle downsampling (PD) to initially decouple the spatial connection of noise. However, an excessive PD stride will destroy the image structure when dealing with strongly correlated noise. This limitation leads to noise insufficient decorrelation, resulting in abnormal color spots and high-frequency detail loss. In this paper, we propose a Tri-Mask Feature Extraction (TMFE) module, which utilizes a parallel branch structure with predefined masks of different shapes that form blind-area to extract multi-perspective features, enabling the network to fully understand the noise distribution. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-Pixel Information Enhancement (MPIE) module, which captures more neighborhood pixels to reconstruct blind-area and enhance local-global features, then preserve more high-frequency details. Cross-Gated Fusion Network (CGFN) uses cross-concatenation and gated weighting to eliminate redundant features and achieve complementary information fusion. Extensive experiments are conducted on SIDD and DND datasets, and our method achieves competitive performance, which improves denoising performance, preserves texture details, and mitigates aliasing artifacts.

To address challenges in existing research, this paper models the interbank lending network using a multi-agent approach and generates a dynamic network through a bidirectional matching mechanism(BiMM). Additionally, We divide banks into three categories based on realistic bank balance sheet data. Given the fact that banks of different categories exhibit different degrees of contagion, we propose the weighted DebtRank (W-DebtRank). Then, comprehensive simulation analysis is conducted on the risk contagion of heterogeneous banks in the dynamic network using W-DebtRank. The proposed method addresses four issues: the heterogeneity of banks, the dynamic nature of networks, the practicality of lending strategies, and the comprehensiveness of risk analysis. The model is validated using the SRISK metric and the Monte Carlo-based SYMBOL simulation model. Through multiple perspectives in simulation experiments, the risk contagion process among banks is deeply investigated in our paper.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4174	1873-6793										Serv Comp Tongji Univ, Key Lab Embedded Syst, Minist Educ, 4800 Caoan Gonglu Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R ChinaTechnol Tongji Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 4800 Caoan Gonglu Rd, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab, 701 Yunjin Rd, Shanghai 200232, Peoples R China	Technol Tongji UnivShanghai Artificial Intelligence Lab			2024-08-18	WOS:001291333600001

Thus, face presentation attack detection has emerged as an important research topic in recent years. Existing methods for face presentation attack detection are affected by different cameras and display devices, and their performance is degraded in cross-database testing. In this paper, we propose a face presentation attack detection scheme that fuses multi-perspective dynamic features. One feature is the globally extracted temporal motion pattern of a face in a video. This involves mapping the local and global motion information of the face in the video into a single image. The motion patterns of genuine and fake faces are different, and these patterns are independent of cameras and display devices. Another feature is the visual rhythm of noise patterns, which differs significantly between single and secondary imaging. The proposed scheme fuses these two features at the decision level. Cross-database tests were conducted among the CASIA-FASD, MSU-MFSD and Replay-Attack databases. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2169-3536											Henan Inst Sci & Technol, Xinxiang 453003, Henan, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R ChinaNYU, Courant Inst Math, New York, NY 10012 USA				2020-04-21	WOS:000524666400011

The Internet of Things (IoT) has an inherent potential to enhance MS economic growth and maintain its dominance in global markets by using a vast network of smart sensors; nevertheless, IoT technology adoption in the MS remains in the early phase. This research aims to define the antecedents that affect IoT adoption in the MS and propose a conceptual model to explain the adoption intention. Based on an extensive literature review, the proposed model was constructed by three main antecedents: perceived value, perceived benefits, and perceived challenges, and 11 related variables. The model development used a multi-theoretical perspective by integrating three theories: the value-based adoption model, the diffusion of innovation theory, and the technology-organization-environment framework.

J	Dai, Hua; Lin, Jie; Long, Qingqi										A fractal perspective-based methodological framework for supply chain modelling and distributed simulation with multi-agent system								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH				52	22			6819	6840				10.1080/00207543.2014.919414							Article	NOV 17 2014	2014	With the development of global economy, supply chain, as a recognised complex system, is becoming more complex for analysis. In this context, it is worth introducing the perspective of complex system in perceiving and modelling of supply chain system to address its dynamic, stochastic and uncertain characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodological framework of supply chain modelling and simulation based on the fractal perspective, and presents an all-round and systematic exposition of concept modelling and distributed simulation by means of multi-agent technology. In this framework, different supply chain scenarios focusing on manufacturing, inventory and transportation can be easily modelled and simulated at different scales and levels. In addition, a prototype system which implements the methodological framework and the key implementation techniques are presented as well. Finally, a supply chain example, which supposes manufacturer as the core member, is modelled and simulated with the prototype system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0020-7543	1366-588X										Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Shanghai 200092, Peoples R ChinaHunan Inst Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci, Yueyang, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Informat, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2014-11-19	WOS:000343419100016

Simulations of these systems can be performed using Monte Carlo codes such as MCNPX to aid in calibration or measurement design. However, the MCNPX coincidence-counting routines treat particle histories individually, therefore the dead time of the acquisition electronics is not treated. The MCNPX-PoliMi code provides the ability to model detailed effects such as data-acquisition electronics and system dead times. A specialized postprocessing code has been developed to interpret the collision-log file and determine the response of a He-3 multiplicity counter. The MCNPX-PoliMi simulation provides the full neutron multiplicity distribution measured by the He-3 tubes. This distribution is used to compute the singles, doubles, and triples rates which are the quantities used to determine U-235 mass. MCNPX-PoliMi has previously been validated with passive multiplicity measurements. In this study, a detailed analysis of the measurement system operating in active mode is presented for uranium-oxide standards ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 kg with a Canberra JCC-51 active well coincidence counter. MCNPX-PoliMi calculations are also compared with MCNPX. The two codes agree to within 1% for the cases with negligible dead times. The simulations are validated with measurements performed at the Y-12 National Security Complex. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In current literature, the researches usually focus on the (ir)rationality of traders and its impacts on the bubble. We thereby propose a completely different perspective, that is, of traders' heterogeneity and its impacts on the formation of bubble in financial markets. As in the real financial markets, the agents are always heterogenous. For example, some of them are fundamentalists, some are chartists, some are noise traders, etc. To model the heterogeneity of agents in the real markets, we proposed a multi-agent model to control the constitution of traders. Based on four scenarios with different constitution of traders' behaviors, we investigated three extreme situations where the market is occupied by homogeneous agents (no matter they are fundamentalists, chartists or noise traders), and one scenario where the market is made up of heterogeneous traders. By applying Log-Periodic Power-Law (LPPL) model, We studied the impacts of different investors' behaviors on the bubble formation in the market and found that: (a) the public information has an important influence on the beginning of a bubble; (b) traders' different expectations and their self-feedback is one of reasons for the existence of log-periodicity in bubble; (c) the existence of power-law growth and log-periodicity, which leads the probability of prediction for the bursting of bubble, is caused by the combined effects of public information, traders' different expectations and their self-feedback.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0927-7099	1572-9974										China Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Ctr Futures & Financial Derivat, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaUniv Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada				2013-11-01	WOS:000324097100001

We show that such networks exhibit a dynamic behavior featuring three time scales. Employing a nested application of singular perturbation arguments, we propose a method for deriving non-linear, non-stiff, reduced order models for the dynamics in each time scale. Subsequently, we propose a hierarchical controller design framework that takes advantage of the identified time scale multiplicity. The developed concepts are exemplified through a case study on the dynamics and control of a reactor-single-stage separator network core, and illustrative numerical simulation results are provided.

The possibility of existence of complex nonlinear behavior associated with the TSRFCP process puts limitations on the supervision of this system. Based on the developed and validated model for the TSRFCP process, this paper focuses on the elucidation of multiple steady states and relevant (in) stability characteristic over a wide range of operating condition. First, graphic analysis of heat generation/removal curves demonstrates that the TSRFCP process has at least one steady state and a maximum of three output steady states under the considered operating conditions and uncertainties such as cooling water flow rates and Conradson carbon residue. Then, operating maps revealing topologies between important input and output variables can disclose detailed nonlinear behavior (input/output multiplicity). Moreover, depending on the choice of the input variable and the relevant operating/design condition, input multiplicity may exist. In short, these results can guide the succeeding control structure selection for realistic TSRFCP processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The addressed problem aims to minimize costs by scheduling tasks performed on workstations without exceeding project deadlines and efficiently allocating available workforce within the SSD. To this end, a set of genetic algorithm (GA)-based approaches is proposed, considering multiple aspects of workforce at tactical and operational-level scenarios to tackle the problem from diverse perspectives. Furthermore, a design of experiment setting is implemented to explore key factors affecting the SSD, including the number of workstations where tasks are performed, the workers, and their skill levels. This provides insights into theoretical, methodological, and managerial aspects. By doing so, key findings are obtained by examining how the proposed approaches affect the cost objective with different combinations of factors in the SSD. Computational results reveal that regardless of the proficiency level of the workers, multi-skilled workers achieve up to 30 % higher-quality solutions when employing a specialization-oriented workforce approach compared to a combination of function-specific workers using the same approach. Similarly, employing multi-skilled workers within a flexible workforce approach results in solutions of up to 85 % higher quality compared to using a combination of function-specific workers with the same approach. As such, these results suggest the critical importance of employing multi-skilled workers in SSD for effective cost performance, indicating the need for careful review of planning and workforce management decisions in ship projects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0305-0548	1873-765X										Karadeniz Tech Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Marine Engn, TR-61080 Trabzon, TurkiyeKaradeniz Tech Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-61080 Trabzon, Turkiye				2025-06-22	WOS:001510921600001

Yet such multi-strategy approaches differ widely in how they envision that the different strategies are coordinated and therefore do not represent one unitary approach. Toolbox models, for example, assume that people shift from one strategy to another as they adapt to specific task environments based on past experience. Unlike such multi-strategy selection approaches, multi-strategy blending approaches assume that the outputs of different strategies are blended into a joint, hybrid response (i.e., wisdom of strategies in one mind). The goal of this article is twofold. First, we discuss strategy blending as a conceptual alternative to strategy selection for modeling human judgment. Second, we investigate the predictive performance of the different approaches in synthetic and real-world environments. Taking a normative perspective, we study the coordination of rule-based and exemplar-based processes in estimation tasks. Our simulations using synthetic and real-world environments indicate that, for medium-sized samples, multi-strategy blending approaches lead to more accurate estimates than relying on a single strategy or selecting a strategy based on past experiencepossibly because neither rule- nor exemplar-based processes in isolation are sufficient to capture statistical regularities that enable accurate estimates. This suggests that multi-strategy blending approaches can be advantageous to the degree that they rely on qualitatively different strategies.

The extremal constructions for each problem turn out to be blow-ups of a graph of constant size and were found through search heuristics. They are complemented by lower bounds established using flag algebras, resulting in a fully computer-assisted approach. For some of our theorems we can also derive that the extremal construction is stable in a very strong sense. More broadly, these problems lead us to the study of the region of possible pairs of clique and independent set densities that can be realized as the limit of some sequence of graphs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1615-3375	1615-3383										Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Math, Berlin, GermanyZuse Inst Berlin, Dept AIS2T, Berlin, GermanyFree Univ Berlin, Inst Math, Berlin, Germany				2024-09-10	WOS:001297774400001

A team of robots placed at different nodes of the input graph, has to meet at some node and remain there. Robots operate in Look Compute Move cycles; in one cycle, a robot perceives the current configuration in terms of occupied nodes (Look), decides whether to move toward one of its neighbors (Compute), and in the positive case makes the computed move instantaneously (Move). Cycles are performed asynchronously for each robot. The problem has been deeply studied for the case of ring networks. However, the known techniques used on rings cannot be directly extended to grids and trees. Moreover, on rings, another assumption concerning the so-called multiplicity detection capability was required in order to accomplish the gathering task. That is, a robot is able to detect during its Look operation whether a node is empty, or occupied by one robot, or occupied by an undefined number of robots greater than one.In this paper, we provide a full characterization about gatherable configurations for grids and trees. In particular, we show that on these topologies, the multiplicity detection is not required. Very interestingly, sometimes the problem appears trivial, as it is for the case of grids with both odd sides, while sometimes the involved techniques require new insights with respect to the well-studied ring case. Moreover, our results reveal the importance of structures like grids and trees that allow to overcome the multiplicity detection with respect to the ring case. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, with the continuous development and integration of various emerging technologies in the maritime field, maritime traffic supervision has also shown a trend of intelligent and autonomous development. The traditional supervision method dominated by human experience is evolving towards data and model-driven practices. In order to solve the problem of ship navigation safety supervision under multi-ship conflict scenarios, it is urgent to build an intelligent conflict mitigation decision-making model. Therefore, this paper designs a novel risk mitigation decision-making model for multi-ship conflict scenarios from the perspective of maritime supervision. The model proposed in this paper first extracts high-density ship clusters based on AIS (Automatic Identification System) data and uses the MCD (Mean Core Density) and PRM (Proportion of Relative Motion) as feature indicators to further mine potential multi-ship conflict scenarios. Finally, a global optimization decision-making model is constructed to effectively mitigate conflict risks. Experimental verification shows that the intelligent decision-making model for the mitigation of maritime traffic conflict proposed in this paper can autonomously identify conflict scenarios and make reasonable decisions in real time. It can effectively ensure the navigation safety of ships in multi-ship conflict scenarios and further improve the supervision level of maritime departments.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2077-1312										Dalian Maritime Univ, Nav Coll, Dalian 116026, Peoples R China				2024-11-04	WOS:001341873500001

With undersampled SMS imaging, image reconstruction suffers from both inter-slice leakages and in-plane aliasing artifacts. Aliasing separation becomes further challenging in the presence of discrepancies between calibration and imaging. To address them, in this work a measured SMS 3D k-space with additional calibrating signals is decomposed into SMS imaging and self -calibrating data sets. Extended controlled aliasing is performed by upsampling the measured data in the kz-direction. A slice-specific null space operator is then learned using extended self-calibration exploiting target slices and additional in-plane-shifted images. Inter-slice leakages and in-plane aliasing artifacts are jointly resolved in a single step by solving a constrained optimization problem in which null space reconstruction consistency is balanced with a Hankel-structured low rank prior while data fidelity in 3D Fourier space is enforced. Retrospective and prospective studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in various regions including knee and L-spine.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1361-8415	1361-8423										Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Suwon, South KoreaSungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Intelligent Precis Healthcare Convergence, Suwon, South KoreaEwha Womans Univ, Div Mech & Biomed Engn, Seoul, South KoreaSungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, 2066 Seobu Ro, Suwon, South Korea				2022-11-04	WOS:000872927800001	36156418

It is revealed that the fully distributed protocol is indeed a PI-gain design approach. Based on such PI-gain method, fully distributed observer-based protocols are proposed to solve the consensus problem of nonlinear multi-agent systems over directed cooperative-antagonistic networks, where the neural network approximation is introduced to tackle the unknown nonlinearity. Fully distributed continuous protocols are further presented by modifying the sign function with a decaying variable, which takes the advantage of avoiding chattering problem.

The technology has substantial potential to enhance operational effectiveness and profitability. Blockchain platform evaluation and selection still requires investigation. Blockchain platform selection and adoption decision making in a multi-organizational supply chain context is complex. Effective blockchain adoption and operations requires consideration of multiple vendors-service providers-and platforms while satisfying multiple users and stakeholders. This study introduces a managerial decision support method to assist organizations evaluate and select joint blockchain service vendor and platforms for multiple organizational functions and organizations. Using literature and practice, we introduce blockchain service vendor and platform attributes from user, vendor, and platform perspectives. A social network theory lens sets the foundation for an innovative group decision-making method-a DEMATEL-based hierarchical best-worst method-integrating characteristics from this decision environment. The technological and distributed network nature of blockchain technology requires evaluation by decision makers from various levels of a supply chain network. These decision makers will likely have varying blockchain technology knowledge and subjective preferences that need integration. The proposed method helps to operationalize social network relationships to comprehend partial and idiosyncratic expert opinions about blockchain technology. An illustrative example and various scenarios are presented to identify managerial and research implications. Methodological limitations and future research are presented for this emergent managerial and technological concern across supply chains.									48	2	0	0	0	0	50			0925-5273	1873-7579										Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, 2006 Xiyuan Ave, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R ChinaUniv Alabama, Coll Business, 301 Sparkman Dr, Huntsville, AL 35899 USAWorcester Polytech Inst, Foisie Business Sch, 100 Inst Rd, Worcester, MA 01609 USAHumlog Inst, Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki 00100, Finland				2021-06-23	WOS:000658952300007

Particularly, the use of symbolic computation leads to new contribution to constructing and analyzing numerical algorithms for solving very difficult problems in applied mathematics and other scientific disciplines. In this paper we are concerned with the problem of determining multiple zeros when the multiplicity is not known in advance, a task that is seldom considered in literature. By the use of computer algebra system Mathematica, we employ symbolic computation through several programs to construct and investigate algorithms which both determine a sought zero and its multiplicity. Applying a recurrent formula for generating iterative methods of higher order for solving nonlinear equations, we construct iterative methods that serve (i) for approximating a multiple zero of a given function f when the order of multiplicity is unknown and, simultaneously, (ii) for finding exact order of multiplicity. In particular, we state useful cubically convergent iterative sequences that find the exact multiplicity in a few iteration steps. Such approach, combined with a rapidly convergent method for multiple zeros, provides the construction of efficient composite algorithms for finding multiple zeros of very high accuracy. The properties of the proposed algorithms are illustrated by several numerical examples and basins of attraction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The multiplicity counter [water-based neutron detector (WaND)] contains 1.0 m(3) of water doped with 0.2% gadolinium in the form of a gadolinium salt (0.4% GdCl3). It can be used for testing the presence of trace quantities of Pu-240 within a sample of unknown material by observing the correlated timing behavior of neutron capture candidates in the detector. The new analysis takes advantage of the fact that the detector is comprised almost entirely of a homogeneous medium, which permits the use of a simple model to reproduce the observed neutron capture timing behavior. The results of this analysis indicate that the detector has an absolute neutron detection efficiency of 23.4 +/- 1.1% and is sensitive to a Pu-240 mass as small as 2.3 mg (at 1 sigma) after a 1-h data acquisition.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9499	1558-1578										Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Nucl Engn, Berkeley, CA 94720 USAExponent, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USALawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Nucl & Chem Sci Div, Livermore, CA 94550 USA				2020-12-18	WOS:000591857900017

As the world's largest carbon emitter, China's construction industry generates substantial carbon emissions. However, previous research has primarily focused on promoting low-carbon building products or calculating carbon emissions to propose low-carbon transition measures. There has been limited research on low-carbon transitions in the construction in-dustry from an industry system perspective. This study aimed to identify the driving factors and their in-terrelationships for low-carbon transitions in the construction industry. A multi-level perspective (MLP) was presented as a heuristic structure to analyze driving factors. An integrated interpretative structural model (ISM) and cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification (MICMAC) technique was adopted to explore the interactions among factors. The results demonstrate that a six-level hierarchy of 22 drivers was constructed, and relationship degrees between the factors were discovered. The strongest drivers were low-carbon legal regula -tion, followed by industrial structure and organizational characteristics connected to industrial development. Improving these fundamental factors will increase the probability of successful transitions. The results also demonstrate that transitions are a collaborative process that involves multiple stakeholders. These findings can provide suggestions for low-carbon practices in the construction industry.									22	0	0	0	2	0	23			2210-6707	2210-6715										Chongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Environm & Energy Engn, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China				2023-03-28	WOS:000948886700001

The simulation results show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the average number of gamma rays and the mass of Pu-240 solid spheres in the range of 0.50-3.00 kg. This result provides a basis for using the average number of gamma rays to account for the mass of Pu-240.									4	3	0	0	0	0	7			1001-8042	2210-3147										China Acad Engn Phys, Inst Mat, Mianyang 621908, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaPLA, Unit 93147, Mianyang 621000, Sichuan, Peoples R ChinaCAEP Software Ctr High Performance Numer Simulat, Beijing 100088, Peoples R ChinaInst Appl Phys & Computat Math, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China	PLACAEP Software Ctr High Performance Numer Simulat			2022-06-24	WOS:000811779500008

Yet, as a field of academic study, traditional approaches to work and employment relations face a number of challenges, particularly in an era of globalization. Understanding the changing nature of work and employment relations has significant implications for economic prosperity and social harmony in all societies. How workers engage in new forms of employment, such as the 'shared economy', and exercise influence over their employment conditions are challenges which face not only employers but also governments and society at large. As the world of work becomes increasingly affected by global as well as local factors, a multi-level perspective is needed which takes into account the interaction between national, sectoral and transnational spheres of work and employment relations.									11	0	0	0	0	0	12			1030-1763	2325-5676										Univ Sydney, Business Sch, Work & Organisat Studies, Sydney, NSW, Australia				2018-04-20	WOS:000429356400003

However, achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) or near pCR to NCRT is significantly associated with a considerable improvement in survival outcomes, while pCR patients may help organ preservation for patients by active surveillance to avoid planned surgery. Thus, there is an urgent need for improved biomarkers to predict EC chemoradiation response in research and clinical settings. Advances in multiple high -throughput technologies such as next -generation sequencing have facilitated the discovery of novel predictive biomarkers, specifically based on multi-omics data, including genomic/transcriptomic sequencings and proteomic/metabolomic mass spectra. The application of multi-omics data has shown the benefits in improving the understanding of underlying mechanisms of NCRT sensitivity/resistance in EC. Particularly, the prominent development of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a new direction in cancer research. The integration of multi-omics data has significantly advanced our knowledge of the disease and enabled the identification of valuable biomarkers for predicting treatment response from diverse dimension levels, especially with rapid advances in biotechnological and AI methodologies. Herein, we summarize the current status of research on the use of multi-omics technologies in predicting NCRT response for EC patients. Current limitations, challenges, and future perspectives of these multi-omics platforms will be addressed to assist in experimental designs and clinical use for further integrated analysis.

Such an approach allows its to estimate reasonable systematic uncertainties of available data, which are underestimated by authors of most measurements as a rule. The corresponding uncertainties and covariances of evaluated data are obtained for the most important actinides in the 15-energy group representation. Differences between the present evaluations and the recent BOLNA results are discussed for the main actinides. It is shown that the fission cross section uncertainties axe overestimated essentially in the BOLNA analysis for minor actinides. Uncertainties of the cross sections and the neutron multiplicities averaged over the Cf-252 fission-neutron spectrum are considered.

This necessitates the usage of algorithms for resolving batch collisions (conflicts) with unknown conflict multiplicity n. In this paper we present a novel approach to the problem of collision resolution for batch conflicts. We show how the conventional tree algorithms for collision resolution can be used to obtain progressively accurate estimation of the multiplicity. We use the estimation to propose a more efficient binary tree algorithm, termed Estimating Binary Tree (EBT) algorithm. The EBT algorithm is suited for implementation when the conflicting nodes are passive, such as e.g. RFID tags. We extend the approach to design the Interval Estimation Conflict Resolution (IECR) algorithm. For n -> infinity we prove that the efficiency achieved by IECR for batch arrivals is identical with the efficiency that Gallager's FCFS algorithm achieves for Poisson packet arrivals. For finite n, the simulation results show that IECR is, to the best of our knowledge, the most efficient batch resolution algorithm reported to date.

In order to test those tools, the automated generation of well-formed (or intentionally malformed) graph models is necessitated which is often carried out by solver-based model generation techniques. In many model generation scenarios, one needs more refined control over the generated unit tests to focus on the more relevant models. Type scopes allow to precisely define the required number of newly generated elements, thus one can avoid the generation of unrealistic and highly symmetric models having only a single type of elements. In this paper, we propose a 3-valued scoped partial modeling formalism, which innovatively extends partial graph models with predicate abstraction and counter abstraction. As a result, well-formedness constraints and multiplicity requirements can be evaluated in an approximated way on incomplete (unfinished) models by using advanced graph query engines with numerical solvers (e.g., IP or LP solvers). Based on the refinement of 3-valued scoped partial models, we propose an efficient model generation algorithm that generates models that are both well-formed and satisfy the scope requirements. We show that the proposed approach scales significantly better than existing SAT-solver techniques or the original graph solver without multiplicity reasoning. We illustrate our approach in a complex design-space exploration case study of collaborating satellites introduced by researchers at NASA JPL.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0098-5589	1939-3520										Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, H-1111 Budapest, HungaryMcGill Univ, Montreal, PQ H3A 0G4, Canada				2022-05-29	WOS:000797454000010

Cognitive concept learning refers to the acquisition of specific concepts through specific cognitive concept learning approaches. The processes of concept learning mainly focus on simulating human brain recognizing concepts through the modeling of brain intelligence. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism of multi-level cognitive concept learning method oriented to data sets with fuzziness by discussing the process of human cognition. Through a newly defined fuzzy focal feature set, we put forward a corresponding structure of feature-oriented multi-level cognitive concept learning method in data sets with fuzziness from a perspective of philosophical and psychological views of human cognition. To make the presented cognitive concept learning approach much easier to understand and to apply it to practice widely, we establish an algorithm to recognize fuzzy concepts and incomplete fuzzy concepts. In addition, we present a case study about how to recognize and distinguish any two different micro-expressions from an information system with quantitative description to use our proposed method and theory to solve conceptual cognition problems, and also we perform an experimental evaluation on five data sets downloaded from the University of California-Irvine databases. Compared with the existing granular computing approach to two-way learning, we obtain more concepts than the two-way learning approach, which shows the feasibility and effectiveness of our feature-oriented multi-level cognitive learning method in data sets with fuzziness.									19	3	0	0	1	0	22			1432-7643	1433-7479										Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R ChinaNorth China Elect Power Univ, Dept Math & Phys, Beijing 102206, Peoples R ChinaSouthwest Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Inst Technol, Dept Math, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China				2020-03-23	WOS:000518603800042

Therefore, accurately identifying and characterizing enhancers is essential for comprehending gene regulatory networks and the development of related diseases. This study introduces MPDL-Enhancer, a novel multi-perspective deep learning framework aimed at enhancer characterization and identification. In this study, enhancer sequences are encoded using the dna2vec model along with features derived from the structural properties of DNA sequences. Subsequently, these representations are processed through a novel dual-scale deep neural network designed to discern subtle correlations and extended interactions embedded within the semantic content of DNA. The predictive phase of our methodology employs a Support Vector Machine classifier to render the final classification. To rigorously assess the efficacy of our approach, a comprehensive evaluation was executed utilizing an independent test dataset, thereby substantiating the robustness and accuracy of our model. Our methodology demonstrated superior performance over existing computational techniques, with an accuracy (ACC) of 81.00 %, a sensitivity (SN) of 79.00 %, and specificity (SP) of 83.00 %. The innovative dual-scale deep neural network and the unique feature representation strategy contributed to this performance improvement. MPDL-Enhancer has effectively characterized enhancer sequences and achieved excellent predictive performance.

However, best practices concerning the implementation, use, and impact of these portals are poorly understood. To improve evaluation and implementation efforts, this paper develops a logic model that can help researchers and hospital managers in deploying and assessing the impact of inpatient portals. Guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) framework, we held a series of two focus groups (n = 12 and n = 8, respectively) and an online forum (n = 14) including hospital administrators, clinicians, patients, and information technology team members to learn from these stakeholders about the system-wide implementation and evaluation of an inpatient portal at an academic medical center in the United States. These sessions were supplemented with a Nominal Group process to assess the relative importance and feasibility of evaluation areas. Our Logic Model highlights that patients are at the center of the multi-stakeholder context within which inpatient portals are being implemented, and that collaborative work is necessary for successful implementation and evaluation of the tool. The Model also identifies priority areas for evaluation, and it suggests measures and data sources applicable for quality improvement and research. Applying the SEIPS 2.0 framework, this Logic Model captures the multiple relevant stakeholder perspectives by describing the organizational structures, processes, and outcomes that pertain to inpatient portals. This Model provides specific evaluation suggestions for hospital managers seeking to implement inpatient portals as well as for researchers seeking to evaluate this new technology.									15	0	0	0	0	0	18			0148-5598	1573-689X										Ohio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Family Med, Columbus, OH 43210 USAOhio State Univ, Coll Med, Ctr Adv Team Sci Analyt & Syst Thinking, CATALYST, 460 Med Ctr Dr,Ste 530, Columbus, OH 43210 USAOhio State Univ, Coll Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Columbus, OH 43210 USAOhio State Univ, Coll Publ Hlth, Div Hlth Serv Management & Policy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA				2018-07-30	WOS:000439048500001	30014267

The system starts with specified inventory levels in all buffers and finishes with some desired inventory levels of the buffers at the end of the planning horizon. A schedule that minimizes the completion time of all the operations is sought. We develop a polynomial time asymptotic approximation procedure for the problem. That is, the ratio between the value of the delivered solution and the optimal one converge into one, as the multiplicity of the problem increases. Our algorithm uses the solution of the linear relaxation of a time-indexed Mixed-Integer formulation of the problem. In addition, a heuristic method inspired by this approximation algorithm is presented and is numerically shown to out-perform known methods for a large set of standard test problems of moderate job multiplicity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1094-6136	1099-1425										IBM Res Haifa, IL-31905 Haifa, IsraelTel Aviv Univ, Dept Ind Engn, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel	IBM Res Haifa			2014-08-07	WOS:000338666700002

This methodology can be applied to a class of distributions, including the Poisson distribution (that is, the conditional distribution is the multinomial).

A rather general cost functional is considered, with only mild conditions called for amongst the various operators involved. An explicit upper bound on the magnitude of the controlling electric field is attained in terms of the norms of various operators entering into the control cost functional. An earlier work employing first-order perturbation theory arguments showed that, under rather mild assumptions, a denumerably infinite number of control-field solutions exists for the optimal control problem. In the present work, it is shown that through a bound on the remainder of the nonlinear terms in the expansion, this same conclusion concerning the control-field multiplicity continues to hold.									35	0	0	0	0	0	35			2469-9926	2469-9934										ISTANBUL TECH UNIV, FAC SCI & LETTERS, DEPT ENGN SCI, ISTANBUL 80626, TURKEY				1993-02-01	WOS:A1993KV97900018	9908999

It is expected that personalized medicine, such as molecularly targeted anti-cancer agents, is more efficacious in marker-positive patients, while marker-negative patients may or may not benefit from the treatment. Due to technology limitations in marker identification and incomplete understanding of the role of biomarkers in treatment effect, it is possible that the marker is not predictive. Therefore, it is often of interest to test the treatment on the overall population as well as the biomarker-positive subgroup. Testing both the overall population and the biomarker-positive subgroup introduces a multiplicity issue and leads to type I error inflation if not adjusted appropriately. The available multiplicity adjustment procedures may not consider the logic needed in the two tests. A new method is proposed by applying the logical connections between the two hypothesis tests, and arbitrages between different rejection regions to make the testing strategy not only powerful but also sensible.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-6715	1097-0258										Moderna Inc, Biostat, Cambridge, MA USAStatsVita LLC, Biostat, Bethesda, MD USAUniv Bristol, Sch Math, Bristol, England	Moderna IncStatsVita LLC			2025-07-03	WOS:001517037400021	40497522

For such problems, one common objective is to maximize the total rewards within a fixed number of pull rounds, while satisfying the fairness requirement of a minimum selection fraction for each individual arm in the long run. Previous works have made substantial advancements in designing various online selection solutions for MAB, however, when incorporating such fairness constraints, they fail to achieve a sublinear regret bound. In this paper, we study a combinatorial MAB problem with concave objective and fairness constraints. In particular, we design a new selection algorithm that solves MAB problems from an online convex optimization perspective. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, and more importantly, manages to achieve a sublinear regret bound of O(root TlnT) with high probability guarantees in T selection rounds. We also extend our framework to include more general knapsack constraints. Finally, we assess the performance of our algorithm through extensive simulations and real dataset applications, demonstrating its significant advantages over baseline schemes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-9757	1943-5037										Univ Macau, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Macau, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R ChinaChinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Informat Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China				2025-05-06	WOS:001476343500009

This iterator usually handles smooth situations only (when the Jacobian matrix associated to the system is invertible). This is often a restrictive factor. Generalizing Newton's iterator is still an open problem: How to design an efficient iterator with a quadratic convergence even in degenerate cases? We propose an answer for an m-adic topology when the ideal m can be chosen generic enough: compared to a smooth case we prove quadratic convergence with a small overhead that grows with the square of the multiplicity of the root.									53	2	0	0	0	0	59			1615-3375	1615-3383										Ecole Polytech, UMS MEDICIS, Lab GAGE, F-91128 Palaiseau, France				2002-08-01	WOS:000176695000002

An accurate urban accident forecasting enables higher-quality police force pre-allocation and safe route planning for both traffic administrations and travelers, maximumly reducing injuries and damages. Off-the-shelf short-term accident forecasting methods, which focus on modeling static region-wise correlations with existing neural networks, mostly performed on hour levels and with single step. However, given the dynamic nature of road networks and expanding urban areas, it is challenging when the spatiotemporal granularity of forecasting improves as the rareness of accident records and complexity of long-term future dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework RiskSeq, to foresee sparse urban accidents with finer granularities and multiple steps in spatiotemporal perspective. In particular, we design region-wise proximity measurements and temporal feature differential operations, and embed them into a novel Differential Time-varying Graph Convolution Network to dynamically capture traffic variations. Considering the hierarchical spatial dependencies and obvious context influences, a hierarchical sequence learning structure is devised by introducing contextual factors into a step-wise decoder. The multi-scale spatial risks are learned jointly to boost the risk predictions based on risk-gather and risk-assign networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our RiskSeq can increase 5 to 15 percent performances on two datasets.									47	2	0	0	3	0	49			1041-4347	1558-2191										Univ Sci & Technol China USTC, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei 230022, Peoples R ChinaUSTC, Sch Software Engn, Hefei 230022, Peoples R China				2020-10-28	WOS:000822377000002

However, compared with the formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) images, the FS images greatly suffer from poor quality. Thus, it is of great significance to transfer the FS image to the FFPE one, which enables pathologists to observe high-quality images in operation. However, obtaining the paired FS and FFPE images is quite hard, so it is difficult to obtain accurate results using supervised methods. Apart from this, the FS to FFPE stain transfer faces many challenges. Firstly, the number and position of nuclei scattered throughout the image are hard to maintain during the transfer process. Secondly, transferring the blurry FS images to the clear FFPE ones is quite challenging. Thirdly, compared with the center regions of each patch, the edge regions are harder to transfer. To overcome these problems, a multi-perspective self-supervised GAN, incorporating three auxiliary tasks, is proposed to improve the performance of FS to FFPE stain transfer. Concretely, a nucleus consistency constraint is designed to enable the high-fidelity of nuclei, an FFPE guided image deblurring is proposed for improving the clarity, and a multi-field-of-view consistency constraint is designed to better generate the edge regions. Objective indicators and pathologists' evaluation for experiments on the five datasets across different countries have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. In addition, the validation in the downstream task of microsatellite instability prediction has also proved the performance improvement by transferring the FS images to FFPE ones.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0062	1558-254X										Tsinghua Univ, Tsinghua Shenzhen Int Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Inst Technol, Sch Sci, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaHarbin Inst Technol, Comp Sci & Technol, Shenzhen 518000, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Dept Pathol, Shenzhen Hosp, Shenzhen 518036, Guangdong, Peoples R China				2025-02-14	WOS:001416196700001	39283778

Sketches are building blocks for large-scale analyses that consider similarities between many pairs of sequences or sequence collections. Although existing tools can easily compare tens of thousands of genomes, data sets can reach millions of sequences and beyond. Popular tools also fail to consider k-mer multiplicities, making them less applicable in quantitative settings. Here, we describe a method called Dashing 2 that builds on the SetSketch data structure. SetSketch is related to HyperLogLog (HLL) but discards use of leading zero count in favor of a truncated logarithm of adjustable base. Unlike HLL, SetSketch can perform multiplicity-aware sketching when combined with the ProbMinHash method. Dashing 2 integrates locality-sensitive hashing to scale all-pairs comparisons to millions of sequences. It achieves superior similarity estimates for the Jaccard coefficient and average nucleotide identity compared with the original Dashing, but in much less time while using the same-sized sketch. Dashing 2 is a free, open source software.									10	0	0	0	9	0	11				1549-5469										Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218-2683, USA.Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21218-2683, USA langmea@cs.jhu.edu.				2023-07-08	MEDLINE:37414575	37414575

A novel fault diagnosis method that combines the multi-feature fusion technology and Gaussian mixture hidden Markov models (GMHMMs) is proposed, which is inspired by a data- and model-driven collaborative perspective. With fault-sensitive features first extracted from both the time domain and time-frequency domain, the composite health index (CHI) is constructed to facilitate the understanding of the time-varying evolution. Then, GMHMMs are established to characterize the probabilistic relationship between the hidden states and CHI. To achieve high-precision fault classification, a well-designed global objective function is adopted to dynamically optimize both the CHI construction and classifier model training in a closed-loop feedback mechanism. Specifically, the fusion coefficients with range and equality constraints are integrated as part of the model parameters into the global optimization objective function, thereby reducing the search range and improving convergence speed. Besides, the well-trained GMHMMs interact with each other to capture the correlation information between different faults, and are utilized for online fault diagnosis. Finally, experiments are conducted on a self-developed multi-axis carving machine platform. The results exhibit outstanding performance in comparison with existing methods, particularly attaining a diagnostic accuracy of 95.37%.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0967-0661	1873-6939										Zhejiang Univ Technol, Coll Informat Engn, Hangzhou 310023, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430081, Peoples R China				2025-03-21	WOS:001442994200001

These acquired pictures are the source of major mistakes in digital image vision systems because they are prone to low contrast, poor visibility, and color distortion. As a result, defogging research is important for real-world applications. This study uses a fog image degradation model to define picture defogging as a mathematical inversion and image restoration procedure. The global atmospheric light A and transmittance can be precisely estimated by combining a Gaussian low-frequency multi-scale convolutional network with a median rank detail perspective network (GLFM-MRDP Net). A Gaussian low-frequency multi-scale convolutional network is first used to obtain the low-frequency part of the image, and then the block convolution model is adopted to acquire accurate A. Then the feature extraction subnet and median rank detail optimized network is adopted to obtain transmittance, which can suppress image noise while retaining details as much as possible and extracting features through convolution. Comparative experimental findings demonstrate that our approach is successful in handling dense fog, complicated scenes, and multi-scale pictures. Besides, the no-reference and full-reference evaluation metrics of our method are superior to defogging techniques in terms of aesthetic effect, applicability, and running speed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1976-7277											Lanzhou Univ Technol, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R ChinaDongguan Eontec Co Ltd, Dongguan 523662, Peoples R ChinaLanzhou Univ Technol, Finance Off, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R ChinaFujian Agr & Forestry Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Fuzhou 350002, Peoples R China	Dongguan Eontec Co Ltd			2025-01-11	WOS:001390196300008

High multiplicity events and high luminosity will force one to work under the conditions of a strongly occupied tracker and calorimeter detectors.

Jet reconstruction and correction in a CMS detector in pp and heavy-ion events are considered. The main attention is paid to the new perspective method of correcting jet energy using combined information from calorimeters and tracker detectors and to the background subtraction algorithm. A set of measurements that we can carry out in the case of heavy-ion collisions, such as jet quenching and quarkonia suppression, are presented.

J	Liang, Wei; Zhang, Kai; Cao, Peng; Liu, Xiaoli; Yang, Jinzhu; Zaiane, Osmar				Zaiane, Osmar/KIA-3435-2024						Rethinking modeling Alzheimer's disease progression from a multi-task learning perspective with deep recurrent neural network								COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				138						104935			10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104935					OCT 2021		Article	NOV 2021	2021	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe neurodegenerative disorder that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. Predicting the progression of Alzheimer's disease with longitudinal analysis on the time series data has recently received increasing attention. However, training an accurate progression model for brain network faces two major challenges: missing features, and the small sample size during the follow-up study. According to our analysis on the AD progression task, we thoroughly analyze the correlation among the multiple predictive tasks of AD progression at multiple time points. Thus, we propose a multi-task learning framework that can adaptively impute missing values and predict future progression over time from a subject's historical measurements. Progression is measured in terms of MRI volumetric measurements, trajectories of a cognitive score and clinical status. To this end, we propose a new perspective of predicting the AD progression with a multi-task learning paradigm. In our multi-task learning paradigm, we hypothesize that the inherent correlations exist among: (i). the prediction tasks of clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume at each time point; (ii). the tasks of imputation and prediction; and (iii). the prediction tasks at multiple future time points. According to our findings of the task correlation, we develop an end-to-end deep multi-task learning method to jointly improve the performance of assigning missing value and prediction. We design a balanced multi-task dynamic weight optimization. With in-depth analysis and empirical evidence on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we show the benefits and flexibility of the proposed multi-task learning model, especially for the prediction at the M60 time point. The proposed approach achieves 5.6%, 5.7%, 4.0% and 11.8% improvement with respect to mAUC, BCA and MAE (ADAS-Cog13 and Ventricles), respectively.									26	2	0	0	8	0	28			0010-4825	1879-0534										Northeastern Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Shenyang, Peoples R ChinaNortheastern Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Comp Med Image, Shenyang, Peoples R ChinaAlibaba AI Labs, Hangzhou, Peoples R ChinaUniv Alberta, Alberta Machine Intelligence Inst, Edmonton, AB, Canada				2021-11-08	WOS:000710575100001	34656869

The closed-loop system is described by a neutral delay differential equation (NDDE). The optimal feedback gains (OFGs) that make the exponential decaying rate maximized are determined when the characteristic equation of the closed-loop has a repeated real root with multiplicity 4. Such a property is called multiplicity-induced dominancy of time-delay systems, and has been discussed intensively by many authors for retarded delay differential equations (RDDEs). This paper shows that multiplicity-induced dominancy can be achieved in NDDEs. In addition, the OFGs are delay-dependent, and decrease sharply to small numbers correspondingly as the delay increases from zero and varies slowly with respect to moderate delays. Thus, the inverted pendulum can be well-stabilized with moderate delays and relatively small feedback gains. The result might be understandable that the elderly with obvious response delays can be well-stabilized with a delayed PDA feedback controller.									2	2	0	0	0	0	3			0253-4827	1573-2754										Army Engn Univ, Dept Basic Courses, Nanjing 211101, Peoples R China				2022-11-25	WOS:000879020600009

J									Porras,  Phillip	Yegneswaran,  Vinod	TC: Medium: Collaborative Research: Multi-Perspective Bayesian Learning for Automated Diagnosis of Advanced Malware																												Awarded Grant	Sep 15 2009	2009	Contemporary Internet malware is constantly evolving and making antivirus and intrusion detection systems increasingly obsolete. It is no longer acceptable to simply rely on binary signatures for malware identification. Both current and future generations of malware will require entirely new detection strategies that can tolerate the rapid perturbations in binary structure and payload delivery mechanisms. A promising direction to this end is the use of multi-perspective, behavioral-oriented paradigms for malware identification. In this project, we propose a new approach to 1) automatically extract infection knowledge, based on a multi-perspective, behavior-oriented view, and 2) rapidly apply this gained knowledge to diagnose the presence of malware in host computer systems. For each malware family, a probabilistic profile will be automatically extracted, which captures the invariant behavioral features of its members. This envisioned knowledge-extraction process should provide sufficient abstraction in its invariant behavior characterization such that future malware variants can be recognized. We also propose a Bayesian framework for diagnosing live malware infections on fielded computer systems. If successful, this research will introduce a new complementary strategy for diagnosing malware infections in ways that cannot be defeated through the current suite of antivirus countermeasures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0						0905518								SRI International				2023-12-08	GRANTS:14035654

Although steady state multiplicities occur in the column, a linear control is still possible since a controlled and manipulated variable-pairing scheme that exhibits a sufficiently large range of near linear relations can be found, if we operate at constant reflux ratio. Reboiler duty is used to control the temperature of a stage just below the reaction section and near the top of the stripping section. Stoichiometric balance is controlled by a feed ratio plus internal composition control scheme, using a control valve installed on the C4 feed-line as the manipulated variable. Such a scheme is capable of maintaining the desirable steady state that achieves high product purity and reactant conversion. However, a similar scheme that uses a control valve installed on the methanol feed-line as the manipulated variable shows severe oscillation. It is caused by multiplicity in the interaction between the temperature and stoichiometric control loops. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Strategic plurality in intergenerational hand-over Incubation and succession strategies in family ownership								JOURNAL OF FAMILY BUSINESS MANAGEMENT				9	2			149	174				10.1108/JFBM-06-2018-0018							Article	2019	2019	Purpose - With strategy-as-practice theory the authors explore successful business-owning families hand-over of roles to the next generation. The authors argue for the usefulness of strategy-as-practice theory in exploring the complexity and plurality of best practices in intergenerational hand-over. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - A cross-cultural in-depth case study with best practice cases from China, Germany, Sweden, England, Tanzania, Israel and the USA, based on in-depth interviews of family members and non-family employees.Findings - The authors identified three different succession patterns: a "monolithic practice," a distributed leadership hand-over, and active ownership with a non-family managing director/CEO. Two other types of hand-over practices were categorized as incubator patterns that formed a part of, or replaced, what we traditionally see as a hand-over of roles. Families would switch between these practices.Research limitations/implications - Surprisingly, a monolithic succession practice (a one-company-one-leadership role) was rarely used. Quantitative and qualitative research should consider, as should advisors to family owners and family businesses, the plurality of succession practices. Education should explore a variation of succession and how the dynamic of gender influences the process.Practical implications - Giving practitioners, such as research and practitioner, an overview of strategic options so as to explore these in a client or research case.Social implications - Adding the notions that the family is an incubator for new entrepreneurship makes it possible to show how not only sector or public policy generate new ventures. That family as source of entrepreneurship has been well established in the field but it mainstream policy thinking the family is not seen as such a source.Originality/value - The paper offers an integrative model of the complexity of hand-over practices of ownership and leadership roles. It shows how these practices are fundamental for understanding how a family's ownership and their leadership of businesses and new entrepreneurship develops.									8	0	0	0	0	0	11			2043-6238	2043-6246										Success Consult Ltd, London, EnglandPsykoterapi Handledning Konsultat, Stockholm, SwedenChina Family Business Magazine, London, EnglandCoaching Training Mentoring, Vaihingen, GermanyGeorge Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USAPivot Point Business Solut, Opelika, AL USA	Success Consult LtdPsykoterapi Handledning KonsultatChina Family Business MagazineCoaching Training MentoringPivot Point Business Solut			2020-04-10	WOS:000522473800002

It uses a noninvertible transformation to map an original template to a transformed domain to prevent the recovery of the original template from a compromised transformed template. Generally, cross-template attacks over cancellable template schemes are evaluated through statistic independence metrics. In this paper, we investigate approaches to launch attacks through cryptanalysis. Four typical cancelable fingerprint template design algorithms have been investigated by applying the attack via record multiplicity attack to retrieve the original template. Concrete attack examples are also given to make the demonstration more intuitive and comprehensive. The results show that all of them are vulnerable if an attacker can obtain multiple transformed templates and their corresponding transformation parameters.

The advent of large-scale benchmarks such as VeRI-776 and Vehicle-ID has propelled efforts to enhance search operations from large databases for re-identification. However, several unresolved challenges associated with vehicle re-identification in unconstrained environments remain to be explored. In order to foster research in this field, we have compiled a new multi-perspective dataset, PAKVehicle-ReId, captured by real-world surveillance cameras in urban cities of the developing country of Pakistan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such dataset collected under unconstrained conditions in a developing Asian region. The dataset comprises 80,000 images of 20,000 unique vehicles. Additionally, a deep learning-based technique for extracting multi-dimensional robust features for vehicle re-identification using convolutional neural networks has been proposed. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method on the PAKVehicle-ReId dataset as well as on two other existing datasets, VeRI-776 and VehicleID.

J	Zhou, Yun; Cai, Wenbo; Ma, Yiran; Liu, Dong; Wang, Wei										DBENet-NPI: Predicting ncRNA-protein interactions based on multi-perspective information and dual-branch encoder network								EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS				294						128818			10.1016/j.eswa.2025.128818							Article	DEC 15 2025	2025	Accurate identification of non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-protein interactions (ncRPIs) is essential for elucidating the molecular functions and regulatory mechanisms of ncRNAs. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved significant advancements in identifying potential ncRPIs. However, existing models often rely solely on sequential information to characterize ncRNA and protein molecules, which is difficult to provide a comprehensive information representation for the original sequence. In addition, numerous models fail to effectively capture the intricate interactive relationships between ncRNAs and proteins. To overcome these limitations, we propose an innovative prediction model named DBENet-NPI for ncRPIs prediction. Firstly, DBENet-NPI comprehensively characterizes raw ncRNA and protein molecules by integrating multi-perspective information representation, including sequential information, interval information, and physicochemical properties. Subsequently, a novel dual-branch encoder network consisting of interactive feature encoder (MCANet) and independent feature encoder (HMCNet) is constructed to simultaneously extract interactive features and independent features. Among them, MCANet module introduces a multi-head cross attention mechanism based on shared weights into the Transformer encoder to mine the complex interactive dependencies. Meanwhile, HMCNet module applies a hierarchical multi-scale convolutional neural network to explore the local details across different receptive fields. To suppress redundancy between features from diverse encoders, gated linear units (GLU) are incorporated in the final prediction module. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that DBENet-NPI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prediction models. Furthermore, the generalization analysis and case study futher indicate the effectiveness of DBENet-NPI in predicting novel ncRPIs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4174	1873-6793										Henan Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Xinxiang 453007, Peoples R ChinaHenan Normal Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Engn, Key Lab Artificial Intelligence & Personalized Lea, Xinxiang 453007, Peoples R China				2025-07-12	WOS:001524419000005

As China accelerates its energy transition to mitigate carbon emissions, the natural gas industry has become a focal point of development. The present study examines the current state of the Chinese natural gas industry and explores strategies to overcome technical barriers. An enhanced multi-level perspective (MLP) framework that incorporates the concepts of technology integration and diffusion is proposed. With data from 2011 to 2022, a ridge regression model is employed to analyze the impact of these technological factors on the upstream natural gas sector in China. A case study is performed to assess the strategic interplay between technology integration and diffusion. The results demonstrate that (1) China's natural gas industry has reached a technical bottleneck and inefficient development, facing challenges such as the advancement of disruptive and generic technologies; (2) the selected indicators positively and significantly influence natural gas production, demonstrating that technology integration and diffusion are beneficial for the industry's growth; (3) the improved MLP framework broadens its application, providing a pathway for technological advancement in emerging economies or developing countries.

We manage to analyze the complicated effects of multi-dimensional uncertainties directly from geometrical tolerances and present a general pattern for multi-dimensional geometrical uncertainty analysis on field characteristics. Aided by artificial neural networks (ANNs) which would get hold of the cost surface quickly and serve as rapid interfaces with a calculation speed several orders faster than full-wave code, Monte Caro analysis is accessible and effective to simulate the actual probabilistic distributions through a large-volume sampling on neural networks. Under such data-driven perspective which circumvents sophisticated theoretical analysis, the variations of geometrical parameters are analyzed as an entirety from the viewpoint of distribution. The dynamics of features of distributions of three field characteristics as well as geometrical parameters are therefore possible to be delved and analyzed. Such an analysis pattern is general since none of the steps presented cannot be readily transplanted to other topologies.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9383	1557-9646										Chinese Acad Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100094, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Elect Elect & Commun Engn, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China				2022-02-11	WOS:000751497100001

Importantly, while marketers and public relations experts have taken leading positions in promotion and advancement of SM, project managers are often tasked with delivering SM systems. In this study, a sample of 127 project managers were asked to evaluate and recommend modes of SM development for six diverse firms using a four-part taxonomy. The results show that firms of varying size can employ narrowly focused and low cost SM development modes to meet their business objectives, with well-resourced firms able to use experimental modes to deliver widespread and higher cost 'listen and learn' SM systems. Alternatively, in addition to achieving groundswell promotions and broader business marketing and sales influencing objectives, firms that engage in large scale SM developments can document and implement SM best practices and apply multi-organizational collaborations required for information exchange, customer feedback and experience sharing. These managerial perspectives expose the intrinsic connections between SM systems and information messaging and management within firms. The article builds further into cumulative studies directed at SM systems construction, deployment, and firm capability affordances.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0268-4012	1873-4707										Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Business & Econ, Room 1103,Bldg 24,Copland Bldg 24, Canberra, ACT 2601, AustraliaZayed Univ, Coll Business, FF1 2 051, Khalifa City, U Arab EmiratesZayed Univ, Coll Business, Chair Mkt & Entrepreneurship, FF1-2-049, Khalifa City, U Arab Emirates				2020-03-31	WOS:000516835200028

Furthermore, it is shown that the number of polynomials in the condition is optimal and the degree of polynomials is smaller than that in the previous condition based on repeated gcd's.

The information characterizing the singularity can be captured in a local dual basis, expressing combinations of vanishing derivatives at the singular point. Macaulay's algorithm is a classic algorithm for computing such a basis, for a point in an algebraic set. The integration method of Mourrain constructs much smaller matrices than Macaulay's approach, by performing integration on previously computed elements.In this work we are interested in the efficiency of dual basis computation, as well as its relation to orthogonal projection. First, we introduce an easy to implement criterion that avoids redundant computations during the computation of the dual basis, by deleting certain columns from the matrices in the integration method. In doing so, we explore general (non-monomial) bases for the associated primal quotient ring. Experiments show the efficient behavior of the improved method. Second, we introduce the notion of directional multiplicity, which expresses the multiplicity structure with respect to an axis, and is useful in understanding the geometry behind projection. We use this notion to shed light on the gap between the degree of the generator of the elimination ideal and the corresponding factor in the resultant. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Surveys with 30 subjects from 10 Singaporean families were conducted. These subjects belonged to three generations, namely young adults, working adults, and elderly people. The survey had two phases; during the first phase, interviews were conducted in users' homes to assess their general attitudes and preferences of service robots. The second phase involved an interaction process between the users and a prototype robot in a simulated smart home environment. Users' feedback was collected according to multiple aspects of robot usability and acceptability. It was found that users of all ages were wishing for service robots to help handle home chores, and they expected the robot to complete the task with good reliability and efficiency. However, users of different age groups showed different patterns of concerns over robot usage. A multi-generational perspective is helpful to understand users' needs and attitudes that reflect age differences. It also provides insights into how members of a family share attitudes towards robots.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			1615-5289	1615-5297										Agcy Sci Technol & Res, Inst Infocomm Res, Singapore 138632, Singapore				2015-09-30	WOS:000361003800002

Nevertheless, the scarcity of life cycle inventory data, coupled with the intricacies involved in the collection, presents a formidable challenge to conducting precise carbon emissions assessment. To address this issue, this research proposes a product carbon emissions estimation method in the early design stage based on multi-perspective similarity matching of design scenarios, which utilizes the idea of knowledge reuse through case-based reasoning. Specifically, the case-based reasoning framework encompassing case base construction, case retrieval, reuse, and revision has been outlined, which standards the procedure for obtaining the most similar case. Moreover, the design scenario is defined to comprehensively describe all life cycle activities that influence product carbon emissions, and the design scenario-based multi-layer model is constructed that encompasses the product's lifecycle-related design information pertinent to carbon emissions, along with its intricate interrelationships, serving as the input information for precise case retrieval. Subsequently, a multiperspective similarity matching strategy that integrates both the attribute and correlation information of design scenarios is developed, which accurately identifies the most similar case in the case base, enabling the efficient reuse of historical data. An example of the wind turbine gearbox is given as an example, the results indicating that the proposed carbon emission estimation method aligns most closely with actual machining conditions, achieving a minimal error of 2.75%, thereby unequivocally validating its effectiveness and reliability. This work provides designers with a targeted strategy for obtaining carbon emissions during the early design stage, thereby facilitating optimized decision-making for low-carbon design.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1474-0346	1873-5320										Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Elect Engn, 579 Qianwangang Rd, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R ChinaShandong Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Key Lab High Efficiency & Clean Mech Manufacture, Minist Educ, Jinan 250061, Peoples R ChinaShandong Univ, Engn Training Ctr, Jinan 250002, Peoples R ChinaGuizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Big Data Stat, Guiyang, Peoples R ChinaInspur Gen Software Co Ltd, Jinan, Peoples R China				2025-01-25	WOS:001400155700001

A given oligonucleotide is or is not a part of the sequence. However, the development of the DNA chip technology allows to take into consideration some information about repetitions in the target sequence. Currently, it is not possible to determine the exact data of such type but even partial multiplicity information should be very useful.In this paper two simple but realistic multiplicity information models are taken into account. The first one assumes that it is known if a given oligonucleotide occurs in the analyzed sequence once or more than once. According to the second model it is possible to determine if a given oligonucleotide appears in the target sequence once, twice or at least three times. A tabu search algorithm has been implemented to verify these models. It solves the problem with any kind of hybridization errors. Computational experiment results confirm that the additional information leads to an improvement of the reconstruction process. They also show that the more precise model of information increases the quality of the obtained solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This kind of refinable functions have a sampling property like Shannon's sampling theorem, and corresponding matrix-valued refinable masks possess special structure. In the context of multiwavelets, some properties of multifilter banks related will be present. Based on these properties, it will be shown that there are no symmetric (or antisymmetric) vector-valued refinable functions with interpolatory property. In the practical application, multiwavelets are always required to possess a certain degree of smoothness, which is related to three different concepts: balancing order, approximation order and analysis-ready order. In the general case, three notions are different. But if the scaling function is interpolatory, three concepts will be verified to equal to each other. Finally, a complete characterization of multifilter banks {H, G} will also be given and it will be used to construct some new balanced multiwavelets with interpolatory property for case r = 2, corresponding to which, multifilter banks have rational coefficients.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0219-6913	1793-690X										Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Informat Sci & Engn, Grad Univ, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Sch Math Sci, LMAM, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China				2012-08-15	WOS:000306592300009

Their capabilities for fast dissemination and massive participation have placed under scrutiny the way in which they influence people's perceptions over time and space. This paper investigates how El Nino, an extreme recurring weather phenomenon, was discussed on Twitter in the United States from December 2015 to January 2016. A multiple-dimensional analysis, including spatial, social, temporal, and semantic perspectives, is conducted to comprehensively understand Twitter users' discussion of such weather phenomenon. We argue that such multi-dimensional analysis can reveal complicated patterns of Twitter users' online discussion and answers questions that cannot be addressed with a single-dimension analysis. For example, a significant increase in tweets about El Nino was noted when a series of rainstorms inundated California in January 2016. Some discussions on natural disasters were influenced by their geographical distances to the disasters and the prevailing geopolitical environment. The popular tweets generally discussing El Nino were overall negative, while tweets talking about how to prepare for the California rainstorms were more positive.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5				2220-9964										New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Informat, Newark, NJ 07102 USAJames Madison Univ, Sch Integrated Sci, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA				2019-12-09	WOS:000498398300011

One aspect of such cooperation is behaving proactively. In this paper we will enable our robots, equipped with visuo-spatial perspective-taking capabilities, to behave proactively based on reasoning 'where' its human partner might perform a particular task with different effort levels. For this, the robot analyzes the agents' abilities not only from the current state but also from a set of different states the agent might attain.Depending on the task and the situation, the robot exhibits different types of proactive behaviors, such as, reaching out, suggesting a solution and providing clues by head movement, for two different tasks performed by the human partner: give and make accessible. These proactive behaviors are intended to be informative to reduce confusion of the human partner, to communicate the robot's ability and intention and to guide the partner for better cooperation.We have validated the behaviors by user studies, which suggest that such proactive behaviors reduce the 'confusion' and 'effort' of the users. Further, the participants reported the robot to be more 'supportive and aware' compared to the situations where the robot was non-proactive.Such proactive behaviors could enrich multi-modal interaction and cooperation capabilities of the robot as well as help in developing more complex socially expected and accepted behaviors in the human centered environment.									29	0	0	0	0	1	30			1875-4791	1875-4805										CNRS, LAAS, F-31031 Toulouse, FranceUniv Toulouse, LAAS, F-31400 Toulouse, France				2013-04-01	WOS:000333759000004

The writer, as a part-time teacher in management subjects, adapted his Facebook account into an e-learning facility to support his students in business studies. This paper reviews the current venture by the writer of using Facebook-based e-learning system to support his students. Seventeen academic forums on various management subjects have been set up to provide the learning resources to students on a virtual basis. Such forums are also intended to foster interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary learning and research by their users. The experience of this e-learning system venture is reflected on in terms of a few contemporary systems thinking notions in general and in terms of the Multi-perspective, Systems-based (MPSB) thinking in particular. The MPSB research was mainly conducted in the mid-1990 by the writer and was reported in refereed journals at that time. The present research paper provides an illustration on one of the MPSB concepts, known as 'Enlightening management education'-a concept that was least discussed in the published MPSB research.

We examine the general case with multiplicity constraints, where item i can be chosen up to d(i) times. For the basic precedence-constrained knapsack problem (PCKP) we answer an open question of McCormick et al. (Algorithmica 783:771-787, 2017) and show the existence of approximation algorithms with strongly-polynomial bounds. PCKP is a special case, with a single covering constraint, of a precedence-constrained covering integer program (PCCP). For a general PCCP where the number of cover-ing constraints is m = 1, we show that an algorithm of Pritchard and Chakrabarty (Algorithmica 611:75-93, 2011) for covering integer programs can be extended to yield an f-approximation, where f is the maximum number of variables with nonzero coefficients in a covering constraint. This is nearly-optimal under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions and rather surprisingly matches the bound achieved for the problem without precedence constraints.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1382-6905	1573-2886										Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Athens 15784, GreeceUniv Salzburg, Dept Comp Sci, Salzburg, Austria				2023-05-14	WOS:000981577100001

Through a case study of a multi-national packaging corporation in the plastics sector, the application of an industry-developed circularity assessment, the Circular Transition Indicators (CTI), is analysed in two manufacturing locations (Italy and China). The aim is to identify how this life cycle-based assessment can amplify the company's capability to sense, seize and reconfigure its resources. Data were collected from a company placement, interviews, and sustainability reports. The CTI mainly contributed to the sensing microfoundations concerning the company's life cycle-based perspective and the use of environmental management tools. It also proved to complement existing life cycle-based approaches because it does not identify sustainability impacts, but only captures material flows. Furthermore, the results showed how the CTI implementation benefitted from existing microfoundations, such as the strategic collaboration with knowledge partners and previously collected sustainability and process efficiency data. Finally, it was also discussed for which microfoundations the CTI results could be most useful: to improve internal resource management processes and to support external circularity pledges. This paper contributes an empirical example to connect dynamic capabilities with life cycle management literature in a circular economy context.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1535-3958	1535-3966										Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Econ Studies, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65127 Pescara, Pescara, ItalyUniv Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands				2023-04-11	WOS:000956578400001

Based on in-depth interviews with K.C employees, a story was developed describing the practical experience, focusing on the context, actions, results and lessons learnt. Regarding the sample size, the saturation point was attained on the seventh participant.FindingsFindings reveal that employees that possess psychological capital set targets and generate avenues that allow them to achieve set goals, with personal initiative that makes them proactive to accomplish work tasks and individual adaptability that enables them to adjust their emotions and behavior to fit in a complex working environment, which makes them to think, feel and act positively. Furthermore, several theories, including broaden and build, personal initiative and complex adaptive systems theory, explain the manifestations of PWB of employees in small enterprises.Research limitations/implicationsThe study was limited by focusing on the context of a small enterprise. Future research may investigate other study contexts whose findings might be different. In addition, the study being hypothetical lacked statistical testing. It would be a meaningful effort if future studies statistically tested the suggested model. Irrespective of the limitations, the findings of this study remain significant.Practical implicationsIn practice, employees may replicate these findings to nurture PWB which eventually contributes to enterprises' success. This could provide answers to the psychological challenges experienced by employees of small enterprises, especially in the African developing countries like Uganda where this is a major challenge. Specifically, the workers of K.C enterprise may depend on their PWB to deal with workplace challenges and sustain the enterprise's performance.Social implicationsSocially, there is need to embrace positive social relationships among employees at the work place which will translate into well-being of society.Originality/valueThis paper is exceptional because it uses a success story showing practical experiences of how PWB of employees in small enterprises is nurtured in Uganda. In addition, a multi-theoretical perspective is used to explain the manifestations in the story, which is the greatest contribution of this paper. Further, a conceptual model is still proposed, depicting psychological capital, personal initiative and individual adaptability as antecedents of PWB.									4	0	0	0	0	1	4			1934-8835	1758-8561										Makerere Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, Business Sch, Kampala, UgandaMakerere Univ, Business Sch, Dept Human Resource Management, Kampala, UgandaKyambogo Univ, Dept Psychol, Kampala, UgandaMakerere Univ, Business Sch, Dept Entrepreneurship, Kampala, Uganda				2023-11-05	WOS:001087919200001

The properties of bit-level received voltages over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with binary modulation are explored. By using the properties, the hard-decision, secondary hard-decision, and unreliable positions can be easily determined, and hence, significantly reduce the computational complexity. Compared with the original multiplicity assignment (MA) algorithm, the RCMA eliminates n(2)log(2) n multiplication operations and reduces the number of comparison operations from 2n(2) to n log(2) n, where n is the code length of an RS code. Moreover, a hardware design for RCMA is proposed and applied in the unified syndrome computation (USC) based LCC decoder. Implementation results show the throughput of the proposed decoder can reach a Gbps order, which meets the requirements of high-speed communications.									15	3	0	0	0	0	18			1089-7798	1558-2558										Tianjin Univ, Sch Elect Informat Engn, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R ChinaNankai Univ, Coll Elect Informat & Opt Engn, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China				2015-12-09	WOS:000365028900002

It has been implemented in the platform LACLICHEV (Latin American Climate Change Evolution platform). Exploring the history of climate change through digitalized newspapers published around two centuries ago introduces four challenges: (1) curating content for tracking entries describing meteorological events; (2) processing (digging into) colloquial language (and its geographic variations5) for extracting meteorological events; (3) analyzing newspapers to discover meteorological patterns possibly associated with climate change; (4) designing tools for exploring the extracted content. LACLICHEV provides tools for curating, exploring, and analyzing historical newspaper articles, their description and location, and the vocabularies used for referring to meteorological events. This platform makes it possible to understand and identify possible patterns and models that can build an empirical and social view of the history of climate change in the Latin American region.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1820-0214											Univ Lyon, CNRS, INSA Lyon, UCBL,LIRIS,UMR5205, F-69622 Villeurbanne, FranceUniv Americas Puebla, Cholula 72820, MexicoUniv Lyon, CPE, F-69616 Villeurbanne, FranceUniv Politecn Madrid, Boadilla Del Monte 28660, Spain	Univ Lyon			2023-08-19	WOS:001031637500016

Since the boundaries of the transformed composition space are parallel for typical esterification reaction systems, infinity/infinity -analysis often predicts an infinite number of steady states for a certain value of the bottom or distillate flow rate. Numerical bifurcation studies with a rigorous column model show, that the infinite number of steady states reduces to a finite number of steady states when infinity/infinity -conditions are weakened. Only when reaction rate, column length or reflux rate are lowered to comparatively small values, the multiplicity finally reduces to a unique solution with high sensitivity.

The project employs laser scanning and photogrammetry to generate high-resolution 3D models at varying levels of detail. The study analyzes how these digital objects support diverse analytical tasks ranging from geomorphological analysis to structural assessments and spatial sequence analysis. We present a novel four-layer data integration and service platform architecture designed to manage the complex data relationships arising from this ontological multiplicity. This includes a temporal database to support iterative refinements of conservation strategies based on ongoing monitoring. The findings highlight the dynamic role of digital objects in knowledge production and offer practical implications for database design, data management, and the development of adaptive conservation strategies for cultural heritage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-5309										Chongqing Univ, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, 174 Shazhengjie, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R ChinaHubei Engn Univ, Coll Architecture, 272 Traff Ave, Xiaogan 432000, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Planning Res Inst, Chongqing Planning Exhibit Gallary, 131 Nanbinglu, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China	Chongqing Planning Res Inst			2025-01-30	WOS:001404549900001

The multiplicity estimates of nodes and arcs guide the cleaning of the de Bruijn graph by identifying spurious nodes and arcs that correspond to sequencing errors. Additionally, they can be used to guide repeat resolution. Here, we model the entire de Bruijn graph and the accompanying read coverage information with a single Conditional Random Field (CRF) model. We show that approximate inference using Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) on our model improves multiplicity assignment accuracy within feasible runtimes. The order in which messages are passed has a large influence on the speed of LBP convergence. Little theoretical guarantees exist and the conditions for convergence are not easily checked as our CRF model contains higher-order interactions. Therefore, we also present an empirical evaluation of several message passing schemes that may guide future users of LBP on CRFs with higher-order interactions in their choice of message passing scheme.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1545-5963	1557-9964										Univ Ghent, IDLab, imec, B-9052 Ghent, Belgium				2023-07-26	WOS:001006656100034	37015543

It is important to control the number of false positives or errors that are present in the resultant DEG list. To date, more than 20 different multiple test methods have been reported that compute overall Type I error rates in microarray experiments. However, these methods share the following dilemma: they have low power in cases where only a small number of DEGs exist among a large number of total genes on the array.Results: This study contrasts parallel multiplicity of objectively related tests against the traditional simultaneousness of subjectively related tests and proposes a new assessment called the Error Discovery Rate (EDR) for evaluating multiple test comparisons in microarray experiments. Parallel multiple tests use only the negative genes that parallel the positive genes to control the error rate; while simultaneous multiple tests use the total unchanged gene number for error estimates. Here, we demonstrate that the EDR method exhibits improved performance over other methods in specificity and sensitivity in testing expression data sets with sequence digital expression confirmation, in examining simulation data, as well as for three experimental data sets that vary in the proportion of DEGs. The EDR method overcomes a common problem of previous multiple test procedures, namely that the Type I error rate detection power is low when the total gene number used is large but the DEG number is small.Conclusions: Microarrays are extensively used to address many research questions. However, there is potential to improve the sensitivity and specificity of microarray data analysis by developing improved multiple test comparisons. This study proposes a new view of multiplicity in microarray experiments and the EDR provides an alternative multiple test method for Type I error control in microarray experiments.									3	0	0	0	2	0	4			1471-2105											Univ Minnesota, Minnesota Supercomp Inst Adv Computat Res, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USAUniv Minnesota, Dept Biol, Duluth, MN 55812 USA				2010-09-16	WOS:000282656700003	20846437

To address issues of size discrepancies in target detection and the need for further category code identification, a two-stage visual classification system has been introduced. The first stage presents a novel You Only Look Once-DualSight Fusion Network (YOLO-DSF) model that adopts multi-perspective backbones: one enhances fine-detail extraction via a lightweight space-to-depth downsampling module (LSPDown), and the other captures global features through a lightweight GhostNet structure. A newly developed FocusFusion module (FFM) merges the outputs from these perspectives, reinforcing small-target detection and maintaining the detection capabilities for multi-scale objects. In the detection head, a low-level feature layer is introduced for improved performance on tiny objects, and a lightweight design is applied to control computational overhead, thereby address staircase convergence issues while preserving efficiency. Compared to the baseline model, the YOLO-DSF achieves a Mean Average Precision at Intersection over Union of 0.50 (mAP@0.5) of 98.6 %, an improvement of 4.4 %. Moreover, tests on the Northeastern University Surface Defect (NEU-DET) public dataset have also demonstrated the superiority of this model. The second stage involves a U-shaped denoising network (UDNet) that acts as a preprocessor in character recognition, effectively reducing background noise and boosting character visibility, resulting in an accuracy improvement of 1.5 %. Field tests have demonstrated that the system achieves an object detection accuracy of 96.3 % and a goods classification accuracy of 98.9 %, thereby verifying its practicality and value in industrial applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-1976	1873-6769										Shanghai Univ Engn Sci, Sch Urban Railway Transportat, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China				2025-06-12	WOS:001501976100010

Its key function, automatic answer generation for product-related questions, has been studied by aiming to generate content-preserving while question-related answers. However, an important characteristic of PQA, i.e., personalization, is neglected by existing methods. It is insufficient to provide the same "completely summarized" answer to all customers, since many customers are more willing to see personalized answers with customized information only for themselves, by taking into consideration their own preferences toward product aspects or information needs. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Personalized Answer GEneration method with multi-perspective preference modeling, which explores historical user-generated contents to model user preference for generating personalized answers in PQA. Specifically, we first retrieve question-related user history as external knowledge to model knowledge-level user preference. Then, we leverage the Gaussian Softmax distribution model to capture latent aspect-level user preference. Finally, we develop a persona-aware pointer network to generate personalized answers in terms of both content and style by utilizing personal user preference and dynamic user vocabulary. Experimental results on real-world E-Conunerce QA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods by generating informative and customized answers and show that answer generation in E-Commerce can benefit from personalization.									18	0	0	0	0	0	19			1046-8188	1558-2868										Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R ChinaAlibaba Grp, 205 108th Ave NE,Suite 400, Bellevue, WA 98004 USA				2022-06-01	WOS:000796738200024

However, stakeholders often have different perspectives, making alignment more challenging. Stakeholders in the digitalized sustainable manufacturing industry must be identified and prioritized for effective implementation. Therefore, the present study combines a Systematic Literature Review and Hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision Techniques, including the Full Consistency Method and Fuzzy-Evaluation based on the Distance from Average Solution method, to prioritize stakeholders' roles in digitalized sustainable manufacturing and associated strategies. This study explores various implementation methodologies and their relations to different stakeholders. It categorizes stakeholders, such as manufacturers, research and development teams, managers, mergers and acquisitions, education programs, the 6R strategy, and ecoefficiency, to illustrate corresponding strategies. Overall, the study highlights the urgent need for meticulous planning to synchronize business strategies with digitalized sustainability while recognizing the difficulty in harmonizing different stakeholders' assessments.

This triggers new research opportunities toward task offloading systems where edge servers handle intensive computations of IoT devices. Deploying the computing servers at existing base stations may not be sufficient to support IoT nodes operating in a harsh environment. This requests mobile edge servers to be mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that provide on-demand mobile edge computing (MEC) services. Time-varying offloading demands and mobility of UAVs need a joint design of the optimization variables for all time instances. Therefore, an online decision mechanism is essential for UAV-aided MEC networks. This article presents an overview of recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches where decisions about UAVs and IoT nodes are taken in an online manner. Specifically, joint optimization over task offloading, resource allocation, and UAV mobility is addressed from the DRL perspective. For the decentralized implementation, a multi-agent DRL method is proposed where multiple intelligent UAVs cooperatively determine their computations and communication policies without central coordination. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed decentralized learning strategy is superior to existing DRL solutions. The proposed framework sheds light on the viability of the decentralized DRL techniques in designing self-organizing IoT networks.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26			1536-1284	1558-0687										Korea Univ, Seoul, South KoreaPukyong Natl Univ, Busan, South KoreaUniv Texas Austin, Austin, TX 78712 USA				2022-11-02	WOS:000870727800014

Users leave a lot of historical behavior data when shopping on the M-Commerce platform. Using these data to predict future purchasing behaviors of the users will be of great significance for improving user experience and realizing mutual benefit and win-win result between merchant and user. Therefore, a sample balance-based multi-perspective feature ensemble learning was proposed in this study as the solution to predicting user purchasing behaviors, so as to acquire user's historical purchasing behavioral data with sample balance. Influence feature of user purchasing behaviors was extracted from three perspectives-user, commodity and interaction, in order to further enrich the feature dimensions. Meanwhile, feature selection was carried out using XGBSFS algorithm. Large-scale real datasets were experimented on Alibaba M-Commerce platform. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved better prediction effect in various evaluation indexes such as precision and recall rate.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1687-1472	1687-1499										Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Guangxi Key Lab Trusted Software, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China				2020-10-14	WOS:000574226900001

Successful implementation of innovative technology depends on technical feasibility and on the acceptance by the affected actors. Many studies exist that focus on the technical aspects of HRC, however, research that focuses on understanding the multi-actor concerns of HRC adoption is rare. In an effort to support the successful adoption of industrial collaborative robots, this study aims to un-derstand the concerns of the various actors who work at the operational and management levels influencing future HRC adoption in the heavy automotive manufacturing industry.A literature review was conducted to understand the HRC implementation challenges and the methods used to investigate multi-actor involvement in advance of, and during, the implementation stage. After reviewing existing studies, the actor analysis method was selected to present the actors' perceptions using the action, factor, and goal (AFG) list to understand different actors' opinions of HRC adoption, using a Swedish heavy vehicle manufacturing company case study.The case study results showed that the actors from the same organization had different concerns but mostly positive expectations for future HRC adoption. The actors' perception map shows the details pertaining to Ac-tions, Concerns, and Goals as well as the logical flow between these elements in regards to HRC future adoption. The involvement of different actor groups prior to new solution implementation contributes to a holistic view of potential implementation influences and challenges in the organization. Actor analysis can provide a set of analysis processes that comply with multi-actor perceptions to understand future adoption challenges from different perspectives. In the next step, safety-related issues and under-development standardization are the key challenges of HRC implementation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	11			0160-791X	1879-3274										KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Biomed Engn & Hlth Syst, Stockholm, SwedenKTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Prod Engn, Stockholm, SwedenMalardalen Univ, Sch Innovat Design & Engn, S-63105 Eskilstuna, SwedenScan CV AB, Global Ind Dev, S-15187 Sodertalje, SwedenKTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ & Management, Stockholm, Sweden	Scan CV AB			2022-12-17	WOS:000890884300011

Power generation from clean energy sources may help to meet societal needs such as increasing electricity demand while complying with contemporary global challenges (e.g. climate change). This paper aims at qualitatively describing the development of clean energy technologies in Mexico by using a multi-perspective analytical framework. By integrating a meta-theoretical framework for national energy transitions and core concepts from policy mixes for sustain ability transitions literature, a series of stylised facts are developed to qualitatively describe the evolution of clean energy technologies in Mexico from 1879 to 2021. Interactive governance theory is used as an analytical framework to synthesise these storylines by highlighting the role and interactions among technologies, actors, and policy instruments in governance processes. The case study revealed that the ever-growing electricity demand in Mexico have called for exploring different available energy sources and technologies over time. Diminishing oil and gas domestic reserves, increasing concerns around environmental issues, and worldwide agreements on greenhouse gas emission reductions have been the main drivers for clean energy and energy efficiency development in Mexico. However, different barriers to a clean energy transition in Mexico have been identified and discussed in this study: (1) access to a vast oil and gas resources in the past reinforced the position of fossil-fuel incumbent regimes, displacing clean energy technological niches; (2) lack of investment in clean energy research, development, and innovation; (3) policy paradigms have shifted based on (dynamic) societal needs and socio-political interests in favour of fossil fuel power generation. To overcome these barriers and allow a transition towards a clean energy electricity system in Mexico, multiple policy instruments have been identified and discussed.Crown Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Energy Initiative.

J	Thore, Carl-Johan				THORE, Coralie/R-4190-2018						Multiplicity of the maximum eigenvalue in structural optimization problems								STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION				53	5			961	965				10.1007/s00158-015-1380-3							Article	MAY 2016	2016	Many problems in structural optimization can be formulated as a minimization of the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix. In practise it is often observed that the maximum eigenvalue has multiplicity greater than one close to or at optimal solutions. In this note we give a sufficient condition for this to happen at extreme points in the optimal solution set. If, as in topology optimization, each design variable determines the amount of material in a finite element in the design domain then this condition essentially amounts to saying that the number of elements containing material at a solution must be greater than the order of the matrix.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1615-147X	1615-1488										Linkoping Univ, Div Solid Mech, Dept Management & Engn, SE-58183 Linkoping, Sweden				2016-05-25	WOS:000374972500003

The Welch-Satterthwaite test statistics used in this procedure do not have a simple multivariate t-distribution because their denominators are mixtures of chi-squares and are correlated because of the common control treatment sample variance present in all denominators. The joint distribution of the denominators of the test statistics is approximated by correlated chi-square variables and is generated using a novel algorithm proposed in this paper. This approximation is used to derive critical constants or adjusted p-values. The familywise error rate (FWER) of the proposed method is compared with some existing methods via simulation under different heteroskedastic scenarios. The results show that our proposed method controls the FWER most accurately, whereas other methods are either too conservative or liberal or control the FWER less accurately. The different methods considered are illustrated on a real data set.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0323-3847	1521-4036										Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USAGilead Sci, Foster City, CA USA				2023-10-19	WOS:001079773500001	37789586

A dependency perspective on the adequacy of tree local multi-component tree adjoining grammar								JOURNAL OF LOGIC AND COMPUTATION				24	5			989	1022				10.1093/logcom/exs012							Article	OCT 2014	2014	Recently, Kuhlmann (2007, Dependency Structures and Lexicalized Grammars. PhD Thesis, Saarland University) and collaborators have shown how the derivations of generative grammars can be recast as dependency structures. This connection between the generative and dependency traditions opens the door to a fresh perspective on how to formally characterize natural language and what minimal machinery can cover such data. This article draws on both reported properties of structures in dependency treebanks and properties of informant data to determine the complexity of natural language along two dependency measures, gap degree (a measure of discontinuity) and well-versus ill-nestedness (whether interleaving substructures are permitted). We show that natural language includes constructions that require dependency analyses that are ill-nested and/or gap degree >1, and argue that a grammar formalism on the right track for characterizing natural language should be able to generate such structures. We investigate the adequacy of tree-local multi-component tree adjoining grammar (TL-MCTAG) to cover existent data, examining the relationship between TL-MCTAG derivations and dependency representations. Though focused on TL-MCTAG, this work also advances the larger enterprise of discovering mathematically defined formal systems and testing their adequacies by using both linguistic judgments as well as large bodies of data from annotated corpora.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0955-792X	1465-363X										Univ Penn, Inst Res Cognit Sci, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA				2014-11-19	WOS:000343398800001

We sought to test further the random collision hypothesis. Chimeric mice carrying the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc) and homozygous for the tumor resistance allele of the Mom1 locus were established. These chimeras also display a strong propensity for tumors of polyclonal structure, despite their markedly reduced tumor multiplicity. Considering tumor sizes and multiplicities, the observed fraction of overtly polyclonal heterotypic adenomas was significantly higher than predicted by the random collision hypothesis. This finding supports models of polyclonality involving interaction among multiple initiated clones. The extent of clonal interaction was assessed by statistical analyses that relate the observed frequency of overtly polyclonal heterotypic tumors to the geometry of the chimeric patches and the pattern of underlying crypts. These statistical calculations indicate that the familial adenomas of the Apc(Min/+) mouse may commonly form through interactions between clones as close as 1-2 crypt diameters apart.									49	0	0	0	41	0	54			0027-8424											Univ Wisconsin, McArdle Lab Canc Res, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Wisconsin, Dept Ophthalmol & Visual Sci, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Wisconsin, Dept Stat, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Wisconsin, Dept Biostat & Med Informat, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Wisconsin, Genet Lab, Madison, WI 53706 USAUniv Wisconsin, Waisman Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USAVanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Pathol, Nashville, TN 37232 USA				2005-05-10	WOS:000229048500058	15870186

These phases are described by solutions of fixed-point equations with characteristic retrieval errors. They emerge if the gain of the neural input-output relation is varied. The number of these phases increases as Q2 with the number Q of gray levels available to each neuron. Implications for the optimal gain function and basins of attraction are briefly discussed. Again, networks endowed with pseudoinverse couplings are found to perform better than networks with Hebbian couplings: at moderate loading levels phases with retrieval errors are destabilized, whereas the error-free phase remains stable up to the theoretically possible maximum, if the gain parameter is properly chosen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4715											KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN,INST THEORET FYS,B-3001 LOUVAIN,BELGIUM				1994-09-01	WOS:A1994PM47600017

To test this hypothesis, we used a large survey data set of Internet users (n = 3,120) and examined how users' socio-demographic positions interact with Internet access to shape the affordance of network diversity and multiplicity. We found significant interactive effects, while network diversity, as indicated by homogeneity and heterogeneity, was not directly impacted by social positions. The effects of network multiplicity on personal wellbeing also differed by socio-demographic background. We argue that, without an understanding of socio-demographic disparities, a focus on Internet affordance fails to recognize the social reproduction in the creation and the benefits of personal networks.

Customers receive services from cloud computing systems as a utility. Customers are enthusiastic about low-cost service availability and task completion times that are kept to be minimum. To achieve client fulfilment, the service provider must schedule the jobs to the right resources if the cloud server gets many user requests. The rapid growth in data volume necessitates petabytes processing of data each day. Unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data are all described in terms of their rapid growth and availability. In order to make correct and timely decisions, it must be processed appropriately. In this research, we present BWUJS (Black Widow Updated Jellyfish Search), a multi-objective hybrid optimization-based task scheduling algorithm. This work considers task generation from the Bigdata perspective. The clustering of tasks is performed via the Map Reduce framework with an Improved K-means clustering model. After task clustering, the task priority estimation is performed. Finally, the scheduling is performed via BWJSU based on certain constraints like priority, makespan, completion time, resource utilization, and degree of imbalance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1872-4981	1875-8843										Koneru Lakshmaiah Educ Fdn, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Guntur 522302, Andhra Pradesh, India				2024-08-03	WOS:001263717000035		
S	Shachnai, H; Shmueli, O; Sayegh, R						Persiano, G; SolisOba, R				Approximation schemes for deal splitting and covering integer programs with multiplicity constraints								APPROXIMATION AND ONLINE ALGORITHMS		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		3351				111	125											Article; Proceedings Paper	2004	2004	We consider the problem of splitting an order for R goods, R >= 1, among a set of sellers, each having bounded amounts of the goods, so as to minimize the total cost of the deal. In deal splitting with packages (DSP), the sellers offer packages containing combinations of the goods; in deal splitting with price tables (DST), the buyer can generate such combinations using price tables. Our problems, which often occur in online reverse auctions, generalize covering integer programs with multiplicity constraints (CIP), where we must fill up an R-dimensional bin by selecting (with bounded number of repetitions) from a set of R-dimensional items, such that the overall cost is minimized. Thus, both DSP and DST are NP-hard, already for a single good, and hard to approximate for arbitrary number of goods.In this paper we focus on finding efficient approximations, and exact solutions, for DSP and DST instances where the number of goods is some fixed constant. In particular, we show that when R is fixed both DSP and DST can be optimally solved in pseudo-polynomial time, and develop polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for several subclasses of instances of practical interest. Our results include a PTAS for CIP in fixed dimension, and a more efficient (combinatorial) scheme for CIP infinity, where the multiplicity constraints are omitted. Our approximation scheme for CIP infinity is based on a non-trivial application of the fast scheme for the fractional covering problem, proposed recently by Fleischer [FI-04].					2nd International Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms2nd International Workshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms	SEP 14-16, 2004SEP 14-16, 2004	Univ Salerno, Dipartiment Informat ApplicatUniv Salerno, Dipartiment Informat Applicat	Bergen, NORWAYBergen, NORWAY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743	1611-3349	3-540-24574-X									Technion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, Israel				2004-01-01	WOS:000228666700011

However, existing studies primarily focused on generating an accurate and compact timing macro model for single-corner libraries, making it difficult to adapt these approaches to multi-corner situations. This either incurs substantial engineering effort or results in significant performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we offer a fresh perspective on the timing macro modeling problem by drawing inspiration from recommendation systems and formulating it as a matrix completion task. We propose a neural collaborative filtering-based framework capable of capturing the convoluted relationships between circuit pins and timing corners. This framework enables the precise identification of timing variant regions across different corners. Additionally, we design several training features and implement various training techniques to enhance precision. Experimental results show that our framework reduces model sizes by more than 10% compared to state-of-the-art single-corner approaches, while maintaining competitive timing accuracy and exhibiting significant runtime improvements. Furthermore, when applied to unseen corners, our framework consistently delivers superior performance, demonstrating its potential for use in off-corner chiplets in a heterogeneous integration system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0070	1937-4151										Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USANVIDIA Res Taiwan, Taipei 114066, TaiwanSynopsys Inc, Taipei 110208, TaiwanSynopsys Inc, Hsinchu 300093, TaiwanNatl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Elect Engn, Taipei 106319, Taiwan	NVIDIA Res TaiwanSynopsys IncSynopsys Inc			2024-10-03	WOS:001319522900026

During the data processing, it is necessary to merge features associated with one compound to prevent multiplicities in the data and possible misidentification. The processing tools that are currently employed use complex algorithms to detect abundances, such as adducts or isotopes. However, most of them are not able to deal with unpredictable adducts and in-source fragments. We introduce a simple open-source R-script CROP based on Pearson pairwise correlations and retention time together with a graphical representation of the correlation network to remove these redundant features.									11	1	0	0	11	0	13			1367-4803	1460-2059										Palacky Univ Olomouc, Inst Mol & Translat Med, Lab Metabol, Olomouc 77900, Czech RepublicUniv Hosp Olomouc, Dept Clin Biochem, Olomouc 77900, Czech RepublicPalacky Univ Olomouc, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, Fac Sci, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic				2020-06-16	WOS:000537450900049	31930393

Moreover, Lean principles, with the aim of reducing wastes, could be one of the main research streams in SC in recent years. Therefore, it is valuable to figure out the mutual effects of Lean principles and digital technologies as two growing areas in SC. Previous works did not pay attention to investigating this relationship at the SC level and were more focused on the production level. However, the present work addresses this issue by conducting a multi-perspective Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Additionally, in the present SLR, the impact of individual Industry 4.0 technologies in relation to Lean principles was investigated from various SC perspectives. The results reveal the necessity of studying single SC processes in Lean Digital SC. Moreover, the applicability of each technology should be illustrated to alleviate SC operational and organizational issues. The results provide useful insights about applying single digital technologies as well as a combination of them to each SC process to solve specific issues.									13	0	0	0	0	0	14				2076-3417										Politecn Torino, Dept Management & Prod Engn, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy				2022-03-05	WOS:000758219100001		
J	Quan, H; Luo, XH; Capizzi, T										Multiplicity adjustment for multiple endpoints in clinical trials with multiple doses of an active treatment								STATISTICS IN MEDICINE				24	14			2151	2170				10.1002/sim.2101							Article	JUL 30 2005	2005	Frequently, multiple doses of an active treatment and multiple endpoints are simultaneously considered in the designs of clinical trials. For these trials, traditional multiplicity adjustment procedures such as Bonferroni, Hochberg and Hommel procedures can be applied when treating the comparisons of different doses to the control on all endpoints at the same level. However, these approaches will not take into account the possible dose-response relationship on each endpoint, and therefore are less specific and may have lower power. To gain power, in this paper, we consider the problem as a two-dimensional multiplicity problem: one dimension concerns the multiple doses and the other dimension concerns the multiple endpoints. We propose procedures which consider the dose order to form the closure of the procedures and control the family-wise type I error rate in a strong sense. For this two-dimensional problem, numerical examples show that procedures proposed in this paper in general have higher power than the commonly used procedures (e.g. the regular Hochberg procedure) especially for comparing the higher dose to the control.

In classical gathering, robots gather at a point not known a priori in finite time. In this paper, we focus on gathering of all non-faulty robots at a single point in the presence of faulty robots. We propose a wait-free algorithm (i.e., no robot waits for other robot and the algorithm instructs each robot to move in every step, unless it is already at the gathering location), that gathers all non-faulty robots in the semi-synchronous model without any agreement in the coordinate system and with weak multiplicity detection (i.e., a robot can only detect that either there is one or more robots at a location) in the presence of at most n - 1 faulty robots for n >= 3. We show that the required capability for gathering robots is minimal in the above model since relaxing it further makes gathering impossible to solve.Also, we introduce a scheduling model as the asynchronous model with instantaneous computation (ASYNC(IC)), which lies in between the asynchronous and the semi-synchronous model.

We start with the jargon of complex systems and the possibility that a small number of broken symmetries, marked by the edges of a hierarchical series of physical subsystem types, underlie the delicate correlation-based complexity of life on our planet's surface. We show that an information-theory-inspired model of attention-focus on correlation layers, which looks in/out from the boundaries of skin, family, and culture, predicts that behaviorally diverse communities may tend toward a characteristic task-layer multiplicity per individual of only e(29/20) 4.26 of the six correlation layers that comprise that community. This behavioral measure of opportunity may help us to (i) go beyond GDP in quantifying the impact of policy changes and disasters, (ii) manage electronic idea-streams in ways that strengthen community networks, and (iii) leverage our paleolithic shortcomings toward the enhancement of community-level task-layer diversity. Empirical methods for acquiring task-layer multiplicity data are in their infancy, although for human communities a great deal of potential lies in the analysis of web searches and asynchronous experience sampling similar to that used by flu near you.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526										UMSL, Phys & Astron Ctr Nanosci Bldg, St Louis, MO 63121 USAWashington Univ, Phys Dept, St Louis, MO 63110 USA	UMSL			2019-08-02	WOS:000475580300001

In order to achieve an optimal and beneficial agreement the agent needs to consider the behavior and desired utility of more than one opponent, determine a concession tactic based on a smaller agreement space, and use a computationally efficient mechanism for generating optimal offers. However, a mere extension of bilateral negotiation strategies cannot be effective in multilateral negotiations because the nature of most bilateral negotiation strategies is based on interaction with only one opponent and tracking a single behavior during the negotiation process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach based on a multi-party perspective to determine multilateral negotiation strategy. The proposed approach applies the BOA framework (Bidding, Opponent model, and Acceptance) and dynamically models the opponents' preference profiles. In order to estimate the obtainable utility from opponents and help find a good offer, the agent uses an ensemble model made by individual frequency-based opponent models and a different level of attention to each party's behavior. The proposed approach also implements a bidding strategy which applies the opponents' desirable utility to adapt the agent's concession tactic and produce appropriate offers. The results of experimental evaluations on various negotiation scenarios against the state of the art multilateral negotiation strategies show that our proposed strategy can provide superior performance in both individual utility and social welfare and lead to more optimal and fairer agreements.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0924-669X	1573-7497										Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Ind Engn, Dept Elect Commerce, Hengam St, Tehran, Iran				2020-04-02	WOS:000520906000002

However, the limited resources and technical limitations of most manufacturing companies have motivated them to outsource their RL activities to professional third-party RL providers (3PRLPs). Optimal 3PRLP selection is instrumentally valuable in RL outsourcing practices because it has the potential to increase enterprises' economic profitability and to improve their long-term development. Generally, 3PRLP selection is treated as a multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. To this end, this paper aims to build a multi-perspective MADM (MPMADM) framework to offer systematic decision support for enterprises to select the optimal 3PRLPs. Attribute assessments in the proposed framework take the form of generalized comparative linguistic expressions (GCLEs), which can be transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) possibility distributions with semantic analysis in order to enhance information quality and reliability. Expert weights are then assigned in the use of an optimization model based on the correlation consensus measurement. Afterwards, the two-stage aggregation paradigm for computing with HFLTS possibility distributions is used to gather assessments at expert and attribute levels to compile overall assessments of each alternative 3PRLP. Compared with existing studies, our proposal considers environmental and social sustainability for attribute system establishment and introduces GCLEs for 3PRLP selection, which offer greater flexibility for experts to articulate their evaluations. In addition, the two-stage aggregation paradigm eliminates distortion and loss of information and provides decision makers with the capability to control the outcome's precision. Moreover, the proposed expert weight determination approach is conducive to generating reliable weight vectors. Several illustrative examples, sensitivity analysis, and comparative analysis further demonstrate the flexibility and practicability of our proposal.									115	2	0	0	6	0	118			0957-4174	1873-6793										Wuhan Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R ChinaYonsei Univ, Yonsei Frontier Lab, Seoul, South KoreaUniv Southern Denmark, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, Dept Technol & Innovat, Danish Inst Adv Study, Campusvej 55, Odense M, DenmarkWuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R ChinaCity Univ Hong Kong, Dept Syst Engn & Engn Management, Kowloon Tong, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Hong Kong, Peoples R China				2021-01-18	WOS:000598519700016

In deal splitting with packages (DSP), the sellers offer packages containing combinations of the goods; in deal splitting with price tables (DST), the buyer can generate such combinations using price tables. Our problems, which often occur in online reverse auctions, generalize covering integer programs with multiplicity constraints (CIP), where we must fill up an R-dimensional bin by selecting (with a bounded number of repetitions) from a set of R-dimensional items, such that the overall cost is minimized. Thus, both DSP and DST are NP-hard, already for a single good, and hard to approximate for arbitrary number of goods.In this paper we focus on finding efficient approximations for DSP and DST instances where the number of goods is some fixed constant. In particular, we develop polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS) for several subclasses of instances of practical interest. Our results include a PTAS for CIP in fixed dimension, and a more efficient (combinatorial) scheme for CIP infinity, where the multiplicity constraints are omitted. Our approximation scheme for CIP infinity is based on a non-trivial application of the fast scheme for the fractional covering problem, proposed by Fleischer [L Fleischer, A fast approximation scheme for fractional covering problems with variable upper bounds, in: Proc. of the 15th ACIV-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithm, 2004, pp. 994-1003].

The band structure, density of states (DOS), surface electrostatic potential (ESP), Hirshfeld surface, reduced density gradient (RDG), AIM topological analysis, and detonation performance were studied and the results showed that both the ADN and ADN-H2O-CH3OH solutions had hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. By introducing the small molecules H2O and CH3OH, the detonation performance of the ADN-H2O-CH3OH solution slightly decreased, but its sensitivity also decreased. Overall, the comprehensive performance of the ADN-H2O-CH3OH solution has improved, and the application range has expanded. These results are helpful for obtaining a deeper understanding of ADN-based liquid propellants at the atomic level and contribute to the development of new liquid propellants. Methods: The ADN and ADN-H2O-CH3OH solutions were constructed by Amorphous cell module and optimized via GGA with PBE methods in the Dmol3 module of the Materials Studio, and their electronic properties were calculated. Hirshfeld surfaces were generated with CrystalExplorer 3.0. A topological analysis of a variety of molecular clusters was performed via QTAIM. The QTAIM and RDG analyses in this work were generated by Multiwfn 3.0.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1610-2940	0948-5023										Space Engn Univ, Dept Aerosp Sci Technol, State Key Lab Laser Prop & Applicat, Beijing 101416, Peoples R ChinaNorth Univ China, Sch Chem & Chem Engn, Taiyuan 030051, Peoples R China				2024-09-18	WOS:001308108800001	39240367	
J	Oliensis, J										A multi-frame structure-from-motion algorithm under perspective projection								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION				34	2-3			163	192				10.1023/A:1008139920864							Article	AUG 1999	1999	We present a fast, robust algorithm for multi-frame structure from motion from point features which works for general motion and large perspective effects. The algorithm is for point features but easily extends to a direct method based on image intensities. Experiments on synthetic and real sequences show that the algorithm gives results nearly as accurate as the maximum likelihood estimate in a couple of seconds on an IRIS 10000. The results are significantly better than those of an optimal two-image estimate. When the camera projection is close to scaled orthographic, the accuracy is comparable to that of the Tomasi/Kanade algorithm, and the algorithms are comparably fast. The algorithm incorporates a quantitative theoretical analysis of the bas-relief ambiguity and exemplifies how such an analysis can be exploited to improve reconstruction. Also, we demonstrate a structure-from-motion algorithm for partially calibrated cameras, with unknown focal length varying from image to image. Unlike the projective approach, this algorithm fully exploits the partial knowledge of the calibration. It is given by a simple modification of our algorithm for calibrated sequences and is insensitive to errors in calibrating the camera center. Theoretically, we show that unknown focal-length variations strengthen the effects of the bas-relief ambiguity. This paper includes extensive experimental studies of two-frame reconstruction and the Tomasi/Kanade approach in comparison to our algorithm. We find that two-frame algorithms are surprisingly robust and accurate, despite some problems with local minima. We demonstrate experimentally that a nearly optimal two-frame reconstruction can be computed quickly, by a minimization in the motion parameters alone. Lastly, we show that a well known problem with the Tomasi/Kanade algorithm is often not a significant one.									35	1	0	0	0	0	39			0920-5691	1573-1405										NEC Res Inst, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA				1999-08-01	WOS:000084249700006

It includes reviews of games and/ or media, literature (particularly firsthand accounts published by designers and/or users), and analyses of online communities.Findings - Although mobile media learning has mostly been framed as "anytime, anywhere'' their more profound impact may be in the experience of place. Mobile media enables a multiplicity and hybridity of place that causes opportunities and challenges to learning and education.Research limitations/implications - To date, there has been relatively little close study of how youth use such media in educational and learning contexts, and more case studies are needed to understand the impact of mobile media on learning.Practical implications - Those designing learning environments for a mobile media-enabled world will need to rethink some basic assumptions about classroom configurations and learning. Rather than designing for large groups, educators might design for students to be in multiple places in time and place.Originality/value - As handheld computing initiatives continue to proliferate, educators might benefit from taking a step back and reconsidering how mobile media is understood, and this paper argues that looking at mobile media as media with unique affordances makes new kinds of interactions come to light.									40	0	0	0	0	2	53			1074-8121	2054-1708										Univ Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI 53706 USA				2009-01-01	WOS:000211740900008

Many researchers have studied the non-linear dynamic behavior of CSTR for several reaction schemes from a theoretical stand point. The present experimental studies are carried out to identify the existence of input multiplicity in a non-isothermal CSTR. The sulfuric acid catalyzed hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system has been chosen and the regions of existence of input multiplicity are theoretically identified. The reactor showed the same steady state temperature for two input flow rates of reaction mixtures into the CSTR reactor and thus confirming the existence of input multiplicity for the sulfuric acid catalyzed hydrolysis of acetic anhydride reaction system. It was observed that the time taken by the reactor was too long at a low feed flow rate of reaction mixture than at a higher feed flow rate reaction mixture. The model simulations of steady state temperatures were in close agreement with experimental data for the above feed flow rates of reaction mixture conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A symbolization approach especially designed for ECG is introduced, which can jointly represent the morphology and rhythm of the heartbeat and alleviate the influence of inter-patient variation through baseline correction. The symbolic representation of the heartbeat is used by a multi-perspective convolutional neural network (MPCNN) to learn features automatically and classify the heartbeat. We evaluate our method for the detection of the supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) on MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on manual features or deep learning models, our method shows superior performance: the overall accuracy of 96.4%, F1 scores for SVEB and VEB of 76.6% and 89.7%, respectively. The ablation study on our method validates the effectiveness of the proposed symbolization approach and joint representation architecture, which can help the deep learning model to learn more general features and improve the ability of generalization for unseen patients. Because our method achieves a competitive inter-patient heartbeat classification performance without complex handcrafted features or the intervention of the human expert, it can also be adjusted to handle various other tasks relative to ECG classification.									101	2	0	0	21	0	103			2168-2194	2168-2208										Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China				2020-06-05	WOS:000535614100009	31545750

They have been used in the context of probabilistic grammatical inference. Observable operator models (OOMs) are a generalization of hidden Markov models, which in turn are models for discrete-valued stochastic processes and are used ubiquitously in the context of speech recognition and bio-sequence modeling. Predictive state representations (PSRs) extend OOMs to stochastic input-output systems and are employed in the context of agent modeling and planning.We present SMA, OOMs, and PSRs under the common framework of sequential systems, which are an algebraic characterization of multiplicity automata, and examine the precise relationships between them. Furthermore, we establish a unified approach to learning such models from data. Many of the learning algorithms that have been proposed can be understood as variations of this basic learning scheme, and several turn out to be closely related to each other, or even equivalent.									18	1	0	0	0	0	26			1532-4435											Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany				2015-01-01	WOS:000369885500004

Interfacial processes like dendrite and Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) formation span numerous time-and length scales, and despite decades of research, their formation, composition, structure and function still pose a conundrum. Consequently, "inverse design" of high-performance interfaces and interphases like the SEI, remains an elusive dream. Here, we present a perspective and possible blueprint for a future battery research strategy to reach this ambitious goal. Semi-supervised generative deep learning models trained on all sources of available data, i.e., extensive multifidelity datasets from multi-scale computer simulations and databases, operando characterization from largescale research facilities, high-throughput synthesis and laboratory testing, need to work closely together to unlock this dream. We show how understanding and tracking different types of uncertainties in the experimental and simulation methods, as well as the machine learning framework for the generative model, is crucial for controlling and improving the fidelity in the predictive design of battery interfaces and interphases. We argue that simultaneous utilization of data from multiple domains, including data from failed experiments, will play a critical role in accelerating the development of reliable generative models to enable accelerated discovery and inverse design of durable ultra high performance batteries based on novel materials, structures and designs.									87	2	0	0	4	0	92			2405-8297	2405-8289										Tech Univ Denmark, Dept Energy Convers & Storage, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkTech Univ Denmark, DTU Compute, DK-2800 Lyngby, DenmarkUniv Copenhagen, Dept Biol, DK-2200 Copenhagen, Denmark				2019-09-01	WOS:000484341600041

Previous fewshot research works in NLP are mainly based on Prototypical Networks, which encode support set samples of each class to prototype representations and compute distance between query and each class prototype. In the prototype aggregation progress, much useful information of support set and discrepancy between samples from different class are ignored. In contrast, our model focuses on all query-support pairs without information loss. In this paper, we propose a multi-perspective aggregation based graph neural network (Frog-GNN) that observes through eyes (support and query instance) and speaks by mouth (pair) for few-shot text classification. We construct a graph by pre-trained pair representations and aggregate information from neighborhoods by instance-level representations for message-passing. The final relational features of pairs imply intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity after iteratively interactions among instances. In addition, our Frog-GNN with meta-learning strategy can well generalize to unseen class. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GNN model outperforms existing few-shot approaches in both few-shot text classification and relation classification on three benchmark datasets.									30	2	0	0	0	0	32			0957-4174	1873-6793										Tongji Univ, Coll Elect & Informat Engn, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China				2021-06-04	WOS:000649749600017

Performing IoT traffic classification under a few-shot scenario is vital due to extremely rapid growth in the number of IoT devices and necessity to save computational costs. In this paper, we propose MAFFIT, a multi-perspective feature approach to few-shot classification of IoT traffic. The purpose is to comprehensively consider the information of network traffic and to achieve accurate classification of IoT traffic using a limited number of samples. MAFFIT is based on our key observation that traffic behaviour and traffic composition are highly consistent across IoT traffic of the same class. For a flow, MAFFIT will first extract the packet length sequences and packet byte sequence, then encodes the features of the corresponding sequences using feature construction, and finally uses comparative learning to obtain the class of the flow without the additional cost of training a comparison model. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world IoT traffic datasets, the results demonstrate that MAFFIT can achieve accurate IoT traffic classification using a limited number of flow samples and MAFFIT outperforms three existing network traffic classification methods.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2473-2400											Beijing Univ Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Beijing 100124, Peoples R ChinaWenzhou Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China				2024-02-28	WOS:001124167400028

Multiplicity-edited H-1-C-13 HSQC pulse sequences generate opposite signs between peaks of CH2 and CH/CH3 at a cost of lower signal-to-noise due to the C-13 T-2 relaxation during an additional 1/(1)J(CH) period. Such CHn-editing experiments are useful in assignment of chemical shifts and have been successfully applied to small molecules and small proteins (e.g. ubiquitin) dissolved in deuterated solvents where, generally, peak overlap is minimal. By contrast, for larger biomolecules, peak overlap in 2D HSQC spectra is unavoidable and peaks with opposite phases cancel each other out in the edited spectra. However, there is an increasing need for using NMR to profile biomolecules at natural abundance dissolved in water (e.g., protein therapeutics) where NMR experiments beyond 2D are impractical. Therefore, the existing 2D multiplicity-edited HSQC methods must be improved to acquire data on nuclei other than C-13 (i.e. N-15), to resolve more peaks, to reduce T-2 losses and to accommodate water suppression approaches. To meet these needs, a multiplicity-separated H-1-X HSQC (MS-HSQC) experiment was developed and tested on 500 and 700 MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with room temperature probes using RNase A (14 kDa) and retroviral capsid (26 kDa) proteins dissolved in 95% H2O/5% D2O. In this pulse sequence, the 1/(1)J(XH) editing-period is incorporated into the semi-constant time (semi-CT) X resonance chemical shift evolution period, which increases sensitivity, and importantly, the sum and the difference of the interleaved (1)J(XH)-active and the (1)J(XH)-inactive HSQC experiments yield two separate spectra for XH2 and XH/XH3. Furthermore we demonstrate improved water suppression using triple xyz-gradients instead of the more widely used z-gradient only water-suppression approach.

To answer this question we develop an endogenous growth model with altruism and love for children. We show that independently from the type of altruism, a multiplicity of equilibria might emerge if the degree of love for children is high enough. We refer to this condition as the love for children hypothesis. Then, the fertility rate is determined by expectations on the future growth rate and the dynamics are not path-dependent. Our model is able to reproduce different fertility behaviours in a context of completed demographic transition independently from fundamentals, preferences, technologies and initial conditions.

It is shown that for SISO systems the problem reduces to the analysis of controllability of a certain auxiliary system. For MIMO systems, a method is proposed for constructing the minimal order polynomial such that its roots are equal to the squared Hankel singular values. In the case of maximal multiplicity of the Hankel singular values, the controllability and observability Gramians of the system are proved to be mutually inverse up to a certain scalar multiplier.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0005-1179	1608-3032										St Petersburg State Univ Aerosp Instrumentat, St Petersburg, Russia				2015-04-15	WOS:000351233600002

Therefore, investigating the embodied energy flows induced by China's modern economy is important. By integrating the multi-regional input output (MRIO) model with the complex network approach, this study builds two embodied energy flow networks (EEFNs) from the regional and sectoral perspectives. The small-world nature is explored in the current EEFN by assessing the average clustering coefficient and average path length. Findings indicate that any disturbance occurring in key nodes or flows can generate substantial effects on the whole embodied energy system. From a regional perspective, Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang consistently rank highest in terms of centrality indices. From a sectoral perspective, the chemical industry, the smelting and pressing of metals, the transportation, storage, posts and telecommunications, and the manufacture of general and special purpose machinery are highly connected sectors in the EEFN. Community detection further reveals an apparent separation of amounts existing among communities. Heterogeneous effects within communities are also observed. Provinces located in the western and central areas of China act as energy suppliers to promote economic development in the eastern area. Economic cooperation organizations, when taken as a whole, exert more apparent influences on the embodied energy trade system. From a sectoral perspective, the embodied energy use of sectors in each community displays remarkable clustering features. The findings of this study can help formulate fair and reasonable energy-saving policies for suppliers and consumers from the regional and sectoral perspectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A qualitative mathematics with unique power to capture the unity of static and dynamic aspects of recursion is the Extended Calculus of Indications (ECl) of Kauffman and Varela. The ECl is a topological algebra built upon self-referent diagrammatic structures termed reentrant forms. A reentrant form viewed as a generator of state-dependent symbol sequences is a Formal Indicational Automaton (FIA). FIAs embed multiple concurrent dynamic configurations with a well-defined stochastic character. In this paper, we investigate multiplicity and indeterminancy in reentrant form dynamics. In particular, we develop statistical measures of entropy and temperature for FIAs. Further, we extract a Boltzmann distribution for the probability of observing an FIA in one of its possible states, as a function of energy and temperature. This lays a foundation for future investigation of interaction between reentrant forms.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0196-9722															1991-05-01	WOS:A1991FU28400001

Prolonged static cold storage of vascularized composite allografts (VCA) incurs damage and imposes transportation limits to their viability and availability. Tissue ischemia, the major clinical indication, is strongly correlated with negative transplantation outcomes. Machine perfusion and normothermia can extend preservation times. This perspective introduces multiplexed multi-electrode bioimpedance spectroscopy (MMBIS), an established bioanalytical method to quantify the interaction of the electrical current with tissue components, capable of measuring tissue edema, as a quantitative, noninvasive, real-time, continuous monitoring technique to provide crucially needed assessment of graft preservation efficacy and viability. MMBIS must be developed, and appropriate models explored to address the highly complex multi-tissue structures and time-temperature changes of VCA. Combined with artificial intelligence (AI), MMBIS can serve to stratify allografts for improvement in transplantation outcomes.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6				2306-5354										Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Biomed Engn, Bioelect Biosensors & Biochips C3B, College Stn, TX 77843 USARoche Diagnost, Test Dev, 9115 Hague Rd, Indianapolis, IN 46256 USAWildtype Inc, Media & Metab, 2325 3rd St, San Francisco, CA 94107 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Dept Biomed Engn, Baltimore, MD 21231 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Translat Tissue Engn Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21231 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAJohns Hopkins Univ, Inst Nanobiotechnol, Baltimore, MD 21218 USAHouston Methodist Inst Acad Med, Dept Cardiovasc Sci, 6670 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USAHouston Methodist Res Inst, 6670 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USAABTECH Sci Inc, Biotechnol Res Pk,800 East Leigh St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA	Wildtype IncABTECH Sci Inc			2023-06-23	WOS:000992679900001	37106621

In order to decrease capital expenditure and operational expenditure, multi-tenant slicing provides resource sharing mechanisms among multiple infrastructure providers (InPs). However, one of the main challenges for cooperation among InPs is to meet the diverse demands of various services considering the different structural characteristics of each InP. In this paper, we investigate on-demand cooperation among multiple infrastructure networks from a perspective of the complex network. Four typical network topologies are used to imitate different practical infrastructure networks. The proposed cooperation strategy contains two stages, the selection of connectors and the creation of interconnections. We adopt the complex network theory to obtain the topological information of infrastructure networks. With the topological information, connectors are selected with selection fitness, and interconnections between connectors are created using the two-sided matching. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, and the effects of variables in the two stages are analyzed. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed strategy performs better in terms of meeting the demand.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2169-3536											Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Key Lab Network Syst Architecture & Conve, Beijing 100876, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing Lab Adv Informat Networks, Beijing 100876, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Informat & Commun Engn, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China				2019-01-14	WOS:000454789200001

Different from most conventional studies that regard coordination as holistic optimization, in which power systems monopolize the additional payoff brought by coordination while heating systems suffer from higher heat supply costs, this work considers coordinated dispatch from a novel multi-party perspective to ensure the privacy protection, mutual benefit, and mutual trust of all participants. Based on the existing works that address the privacy issue well, we propose a transfer payment strategy to ensure that both heating systems and power systems benefit from coordinated dispatch. The calculation of transfer payments is performed through a parametric programming method, which discloses only the payoff variation and maintains the privacy of the payoff itself. Finally, a critical region tracking method is developed to confirm the authenticity of the information exchanged between power systems and heating systems, which prevents possible defrauding. Numerical tests indicate that our proposed approach achieves the mutual benefit of both systems in coordinated dispatch and detects inauthentic information effectively to ensure mutual trust.									13	3	0	0	0	0	15			1949-3029	1949-3037										Tsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China				2021-12-27	WOS:000731149800026

Ideal and nonideal mixing are introduced to investigate the mixing condition effect on the CSTR dynamic behavior. It is verified that the input multiplicity origins include the output multiplicity and the nonideal mixing bypass effect. The former leads to instability in the first-order process, while the latter transforms the first-order process into a lead-lag process and introduces a positive zero transfer function. The start-up diagrams established with both ideal and nonideal mixings are of critical importance to identify the unique and multiple operating regions. We also analyzed the stability conditions based on the pole and the zero of the lead-lag process, which is determined by the nonideal mixing and dominates the behaviors of a real isothermal CSTR with control. The linear and nonlinear integral controller regulatory response simulation results demonstrate that the controller performance could be deteriorated by nonideal mixing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-3839	2158-7299										Natl Chin Yi Univ Technol, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, 57,Sec 2,Zhongshan Rd, Taichung 411030, Taiwan				2024-10-16	WOS:001329475900001

A given element from an oligonucleotide library is or is not a part of the target sequence. However, the DNA chip technology has been developed and it enables to receive a partial information about multiplicity of each oligonucleotide the analyzed sequence consist of. Currently, it is not possible to assess the exact data of such type but even partial information should be very useful.Two realistic multiplicity information models are taken into consideration in this paper. The first one, called "one and many" assumes that it is possible to obtain information if a given oligonucleotide occurs in a reconstructed sequence once or more than once. According to the second model, called "one, two and many", one is able to receive from biochemical experiment information if a given oligonucleotide is present in an analyzed sequence once, twice or at least three times.An ant colony optimization algorithm has been implemented to verify the above models and to compare with existing algorithms for sequencing by hybridization which utilize the additional information. The proposed algorithm solves the problem with any kind of hybridization errors. Computational experiment results confirm that using even the partial information about multiplicity leads to increased quality of reconstructed sequences. Moreover, they also show that the more precise model enables to obtain better solutions and the ant colony optimization algorithm outperforms the existing ones.Test data sets and the proposed ant colony optimization algorithm are available on: http://bioserver. cs.put.poznan.pl/download/ACO4mSBH.zip.

Existing methods typically use the chemical structure and molecular properties of drugs, as well as the sequence and three-dimensional structural features of proteins. These features are converted into low-dimensional dense vectors using deep learning methods (e.g. GCN and word2vec) and then fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the probability of interaction between drug molecules and biological targets. However, these methods struggle to simultaneously capture local and global drug-target features, and cannot exploit the complex topological relationships in drug-target interaction networks. This study proposes a multi-perspective fusion model for predicting potential drug-target interactions (DTI-MPFM). First, a multimodal drug-target knowledge graph (BBDKG) is constructed and complex topological information is extracted using Rescal. Next, the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) of drugs and protein sequences are re-encoded using a character dictionary encoding method. CNN and Transformer are then used to extract local and global features respectively. Finally, in order to obtain high-order interaction information between sparse characteristics and determine the likelihood of drug-target binding, linear fusion is employed.

We show that such codes can be constructed on the basis of weighing one of the data vector's bits by a natural number w = 2 and then calculating the total weight of the data vector modulo the Berger code (M = 2[(log)(2)(m(+1)])). We establish the basic characteristics of the new class of sum codes. Compared with the Berger code, the proposed codes have the advantage of detecting symmetrical errors while maintaining the property of detecting any unidirectional and asymmetrical errors up to fixed multiplicities. Such codes can be effectively used in the construction of concurrent error-detection systems for combinational logic devices and, especially, in the construction of systems with the detection of all single faults in the controlled device.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0005-1179	1608-3032										LocoTech Signal LLC, Moscow, RussiaRussian Univ Transport, Moscow, RussiaEmperor Alexander 1 St Petersburg State Transport, St Petersburg, Russia	LocoTech Signal LLC			2019-06-25	WOS:000470979400007

The change affects socio-technical systems by shifting assemblies of constituent sub-systems. Using Multi-Level Perspective, MLP, technology transition literature has numerous instances explaining shifting of assemblies for socio-technical systems from stability, change, and transitions based on neo-Schumpeterian approach. Two approaches mainly characterize evolution and are 1) neo-Schumpeterian - variation, selection, and retention, and 2) naturalistic - novelty, emergence, and dissemination. Unique characteristic exists between society and E-Governance where one influences the other and acted upon by the other. E-Governance literature has relatively little attention as transition studies analyzing the interplay of developments at macro, meso and micro levels. Therefore, the author extended MLP to E-Governance systems by considering both approaches of evolution. It is essential to understand the context in which the interplay of developments takes place; moreover, transitions can have several trajectories or pathways. Therefore, the author selected case study with multiple E-Governance cases to represent various trajectories. The selected cases were from Central and state governments of India and represented domains citizen services, workflow automation of different magnitudes, and integration of departments. The case selection considered all three government scenarios. Governments implement E-Governance with a participating organization, the author during case selection ensured diverse participating organizations. In doing so, did analyze the interplay of developments in E-Governance and developed a multi-scalar MLP for E-Governance. Structuration and temporal dimensions along with spatial explain interoperations in E-Governance. By improving spatial dimension, actors can develop organizational capabilities to share information and increase knowledge management resulting in better interoperations within and among themselves. In doing so, actors can improve processes by developing activities that help in the better cumulation of the radical innovations as stable designs. In other words, process innovations assist to stabilize product innovations. The author from the selected cases noted a technology deterministic approach with the latest ICT innovations and traditional forms of organizing, with cases that exhibit new forms of organizing it is possible to obtain more insights to improve interoperability.									27	0	0	0	0	1	28			0040-1625	1873-5509										Indian Inst Management Indore, Dept Informat Syst, Rau Pithampur Rd, Indore 453556, Madhya Pradesh, India				2017-11-19	WOS:000412611700008

We consider the gathering problem in unoriented and anonymous rings, which requires that all robots eventually keep their positions at a common non-predefined node. Since the gathering problem cannot be solved without any additional capability to robots, all the previous results assume some capability of robots, such as the agreement of local view. In this paper, we focus on the multiplicity detection capability. This paper presents a deterministic gathering algorithm with local-weak multiplicity detection, which provides a robot with information about whether its current node has more than one robot or not. This assumption is strictly weaker than that in previous works. Our algorithm achieves the gathering from an aperiodic and asymmetric configuration with 2 < k < n/2 robots, where n is the number of nodes. We also show that our algorithm is asymptotically time-optimal one, i.e., the time complexity of our algorithm is O(n). Interestingly, despite the weaker assumption, it achieves significant improvement compared to the previous algorithm, which takes O(kn) time for k robots.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0916-8508	1745-1337										Ritsumeikan Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Kusatsu 5258577, JapanNagoya Inst Technol, Grad Sch Engn, Nagoya, Aichi 4668555, JapanHiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Hiroshima 7398527, JapanOsaka Univ, Grad Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan				2013-07-10	WOS:000320014500009

In this study, we ask research questions: what types of stereotypes from the host country stakeholders may contribute to EMNEs' LORs, and how do EMNEs change these stereotypes over time? We conduct a case study on Chinese telecom Huawei and examine its entries in European and US markets. Our findings show three types of country-of-origin stereotypes: capability-, ethics- and government and enterprise relationship-based stereotypes contribute to LORs. We also find that EMNEs adopt three cognitive institutional entrepreneurship strategies: differentiation, replacement and complementation to address these stereotypes. Our study provides a more fine-grained understanding of the relationship between stereotypes and LORs, and provides a new perspective for EMNEs to mitigate multi-faceted LORs. We also contribute to institutional entrepreneurship research by discussing it at cognitive level.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-6757	1751-6765										Tianjin Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Hexi 300222, Tianjin, Peoples R ChinaNankai Univ, Business Sch, Tianjin, Peoples R ChinaUppsala Univ, Dept Business Studies, Uppsala, SwedenShenzhen MSU BIT Univ, Dept Econ, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Business Adm, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Gongshang Univ, Zheshang Res Inst, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2025-03-07	WOS:001433997300010

In the case of the archives at the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, these are the voices of the residential school Survivors, their families, and their home communities. These voices have the power to fill gaps in historical narratives and confront the millions of colonial records created by the government departments and religious entities that ran the schools for more than a century. That said, how do we transition from acknowledging our past role as protectors of colonialism's documented "success" to successfully implementing decolonizing practices? This paper deconstructs colonial records and colonial "truth" to understand the plurality of provenance in archives. This is especially important as Indigenous communities develop their own archives in pursuit of Indigenous data sovereignty and the power associated with archival authority and whose provenance we choose to recognize and preserve.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1389-0166	1573-7500										Univ Manitoba, Natl Ctr Truth & Reconciliat, Winnipeg, MB, Canada				2024-09-07	WOS:001302951600002

The resource-based view (RBV) posits that having more partners in an alliance should benefit a focal firm's product innovation because of more diverse and a large shared knowledge pool among partners, whereas transaction cost economies (TCE) holds that alliance partner multiplicity may hurt a focal firm's product innovation due to highex-ante and ex-post costs, and increased governance difficulty and coordination complexity. Building on the RBV and TCE, this study examines the contingent roles of partner-, alliance-, and industry-level factors (i.e., alliance foreignness, alliance duration, and industrial competition). Drawn from multi-informant survey data, the findings reveal that alliance partner multiplicity does not significantly affect a focal firm's product innovation performance in an emerging market. However, such an effect becomes positive in alliances that involve only domestic partners, operate for relatively short durations, or operate in highly competitive industries. These findings yield new insights with which to disentangle inconsistent arguments in the existing literature and offer important implications for firms seeking innovation benefits from multilateral partnerships.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1447-9338	2204-0226										Xiamen Univ, Sch Management, Amoy, Peoples R ChinaXi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, Xian, Peoples R ChinaUniv Hong Kong, Fac Business & Econ, Pokfulam, Hong Kong, Peoples R China				2021-03-14	WOS:000614153500001

We investigated the critical conditions for preventing smoke flow multiplicity in longitudinally ventilated sloping tunnel fires and identified multiple flow patterns for smoke movement (i.e., different steady states could be achieved under identical boundary conditions). This results in significant challenges for the design and efficient operation of longitudinal ventilation systems in tunnels. We conducted a potential function analysis and numerical simulations to investigate the critical fan-induced pressure rise for preventing smoke flow multiplicity in a downhill sloping tunnel. Calculation formulas regarding the critical fan-induced pressure rise for preventing smoke flow multiplicity, P-j,P-max', were obtained. We demonstrated that a fan-dominated pattern with back-layering flow is physically unstable, and that the fire source location and source strength have an evident impact on smoke flow multiplicity, and on critical values (i.e., P-j,P-max' and P-j,P-min') of fan-induced pressure rise. The magnitude of pressure rise derived from critical velocity P-j,P-cr' is not sufficient to prevent smoke from spreading upstream in sloping tunnels. Multiple steady states can be achieved if the magnitude of fan-induced pressure rise is between P-j,P-cr' and P-j,P-max'. Moreover, P-j,P-max' increases more rapidly than P-j,P-cr' as the strength of the source increases. The P-j,P-cr' is approximately 10-30% less than P-j,P-max' when the strength of the source surpasses 20 MW. Therefore, in applications, P-j,P-max', rather than P-j,P-cr' is essential to ensure the effectiveness of longitudinal ventilation design for smoke control.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			0886-7798	1878-4364										Chongqing Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Univ, Natl Ctr Int Res Low Carbon & Green Bldg, Chongqing 400045, Peoples R China				2020-03-24	WOS:000514214800042

These changes are multi-perspective, including (i) changes in depth-of-cut: the geometry of a feature in the depth-of-cut direction changes during different machining operations such as roughing, semi-finishing and finishing; (ii) changes across the surface: a surface may be divided into different machining regions (effectively sub-features) for the selection of appropriate manufacturing methods for each region such as different cutting tools, parameters, set-ups or machine tools; and (iii) changes in resources or manufacturing capabilities may require the re-planning of depth-of-cuts, division of machining regions and manufacturing operations (machines, tools, set-ups and parameters). Adding the above dynamic information to the part information models in current CAD systems (which only represent the final state of parts) would significantly improve the accuracy, efficiency and timeliness of manufacturing planning and optimisation, especially for the integrated NC machining planning for complex freeform surfaces. A case study in an aircraft manufacturing company will be included in this paper.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0268-3768	1433-3015										Nanjing Univ Aeronaut & Astronaut, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Nanjing 210016, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaUniv Greenwich, Fac Sci & Engn, Chatham ME4 4TB, Kent, England				2016-02-17	WOS:000368996000044

The existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods usually suppress metal artifacts in sinogram or image domains or both. However, their performance is limited by the inherent characteristics of the two domains, i.e., the errors introduced by local manipulations in the sinogram domain would propagate throughout the whole image during backprojection and lead to serious secondary artifacts, while it is difficult to distinguish artifacts from actual image features in the image domain. To alleviate these limitations, this study analyzes the desirable properties of wavelet transform in-depth and proposes to perform MAR in the wavelet domain. First, wavelet transform yields components that possess spatial correspondence with the image, thereby preventing the spread of local errors to avoid secondary artifacts. Second, using wavelet transform could facilitate identification of artifacts from image since metal artifacts are mainly high-frequency signals. Taking these advantages of the wavelet transform, this paper decomposes an image into multiple wavelet components and introduces multi-perspective regularizations into the proposed MAR model. To improve the transparency and validity of the model, all the modules in the proposed MAR model are designed to reflect their mathematical meanings. In addition, an adaptive wavelet module is also utilized to enhance the flexibility of the model. To optimize the model, an iterative algorithm is developed. The evaluation on both synthetic and real clinical datasets consistently confirms the superior performance of the proposed method over the competing methods.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0278-0062	1558-254X										Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Shenzhen Campus, Shenzhen 518100, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaChina Acad Engn Phys, Inst Mat, Mianyang 621700, Peoples R ChinaUniv Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Lowell, MA 01854 USAShanghaiTech Univ, Sch Biomed Engn, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R ChinaShanghaiTech Univ, State Key Lab Adv Med Mat & Devices, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R ChinaShanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co Ltd, Shanghai 200230, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Clin Res & Trial Ctr, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China	Shanghai United Imaging Intelligence Co LtdShanghai Clin Res & Trial Ctr			2024-09-18	WOS:001307429600022	38687653

Multiplicity of infection (MOI) can be an indicator of immune status and transmission intensity. It has a potentially confounding effect on a number of population genetic analyses, which often assume isolates are clonal. Polymerase chain reaction-based approaches to estimate MOI can lack sensitivity. For example, in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, genotyping of the merozoite surface protein (MSP1/2) genes is a standard method for assessing MOI, despite the apparent problem of underestimation. The availability of deep coverage data from massively parallizable sequencing technologies means that MOI can be detected genome wide by considering the abundance of heterozygous genotypes. Here, we present a method to estimate MOI, which considers unique combinations of polymorphisms from sequence reads. The method is implemented within the estMOI software. When applied to clinical P. falciparum isolates from three continents, we find that multiple infections are common, especially in regions with high transmission.									55	0	0	0	45	0	58			1367-4803	1460-2059										Univ London London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1E 7HT, EnglandWellcomeTrust Sanger Inst, Hinxton CB10 1SA, EnglandMalawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust, Clin Res Programme, Blantyre, Malawi	WellcomeTrust Sanger Inst			2014-05-01	WOS:000336095100016	24443379

The proposed method builds a neural network classification framework based on multi-dimensional perspective of codeword correlations, which is inspired by cognitive biology. Four dimensions are employed: global-to-local, local-to-global, forward and backward. First, the codeword embedding method is utilized to map each codeword into a compact representation. Next, Bi-LSTM is used to consider the steganographic features in time sequence and reverse time sequence. Subsequently, a dual-thread attention mechanism is designed to extract local and global features at the same time. Finally, a channel attention mechanism is employed to increase the weight that contributes the most to the current task and the convolution and fully connected layers are used to generate the frame-level steganographic label. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and practical in frame-level detection tasks.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1868-5137	1868-5145										Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Acoust, Beijing 100190, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R ChinaUniv Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia				2021-12-02	WOS:000722960000003

Design/methodology/approach This paper used survey and semi-structured field interviews with 39 young mothers (aged 15-23) from UK areas of multiple deprivations. Findings Participants reported multiple and complex needs spanning interrelated topics of parenting, poverty and personal development. In the majority of instances, participants were either unsure of their ability to meet their needs or needed help with needs, and several described situations of considerable anxiety and stress. Multiplicity is identified and conceptualised as an important factor contributing to complexity, including three component elements: simultaneous occurrence of needs (concurrency), relationships between needs (interconnectivity) and evolving needs (fluidity). In various combinations, these elements influenced a mother's actions and/or ability to selectively attend to needs, with multiple needs often competing for attention, and compounding issues of cognitive load and affect.Originality/value Evidences disadvantaged young mothers to have more extensive and complex information needs than previously understood, and identifies and conceptualised multiplicity as an important factor contributing to the complexity of information needs during major life transitions such as motherhood.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0022-0418	1758-7379										Univ Stirling, Dept Commun Media & Culture, Stirling, ScotlandUniv Strathclyde, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland				2020-04-20	WOS:000524463200001

In this paper, we revised how LSA represents the polysemous words and we explain some bias related with the meaning generation and revised some constraint-satisfaction models which introduce into the equation some dynamic mechanisms. The idea of these models is to take the amalgamated word vector from LSA and embed it into its discourse and semantic context, and by means of a dynamic mechanism, the appropriate features of it is are selected. To illustrate our arguments, we present some networks, providing evidence that polysemous words have separated representations for each sense only in presence of the linguistic context that involved it. We also present an example of how these mechanisms also contribute to support the visual heuristic searches in the visual information retrieval interfaces (VIRIs).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1560-4624	1741-5055										Univ Autonoma Madrid, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Bas, Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, SpainUNED, Fac Psicol, Dept Psicol Evolut & Educ, Madrid 28040, Spain				2011-01-01	WOS:000213319500005

Understanding users' behavior is essential to spot security incidents and data breaches. Although previous studies reviewed different angles on cybersecurity behavior, there is still a lack of an overview of the topic through the lenses of cybersecurity theories/models. This systematic review aims to provide multi per-spectives on human cybersecurity behavior by evaluating and synthesizing cybersecurity theories/models, in-dependent variables, target variables, moderators, methodologies, participants, units of analysis, technologies/ services, countries, and domains. Of 2936 articles collected, 93 studies met the inclusion criteria and were thoroughly analyzed. The main results revealed that the protection motivation theory (PMT) and theory of planned behavior (TPB) were the most common theories in the analyzed literature. 76% of the analyzed studies did not involve a moderator to examine the relationships between predictors and target variables. Most of the studies were conducted at the individual level, mainly involving students and end-users. Social media and mobile devices were the most common tools examined for human cybersecurity behavior. Most of the studies were conducted in the education sector, with a limited number of studies examining the healthcare sector. Behavioral intention and cybersecurity behavior were the primary target/outcome variables in the analyzed studies. The review offers several theoretical contributions and practical implications and provides several research agendas that can be examined in future research.									34	0	0	0	1	0	39			0160-791X	1879-3274										Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Comp, Johor Baharu 81310, MalaysiaTikrit Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Math, Comp Sci Dept, 34001, Tikrit, IraqBritish Univ Dubai, Fac Engn & IT, Dubai, U Arab EmiratesDijlah Univ Coll, Dept Comp Tech Engn, Baghdad, Iraq	British Univ Dubai			2023-05-28	WOS:000991656600001

Conducting dynamic requirements analysis is increasingly important in the process while the value co-creation of smart PSS stakeholders has not been sufficiently considered. This study adopts a user-manufacturer value co-creation perspective to explore smart PSS dynamic requirement elicitation and forecasting. Using multi-source data of user online reviews, historical descriptive texts and patent abstracts, this study dynamically elicits the smart PSS innovation requirements using dynamic topic model (DTM) and bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT). Furthermore, the key innovation requirements of smart PSS are identified by integrating their importance and satisfaction values into a dynamic importance- performance analysis (DIPA). Then, the trend of smart PSS key innovation requirements is predicted by the grey forecasting model to determine the smart PSS improvement direction. An empirical study of smartwatch service system is conducted to validate the proposed approach. By blending both user and manufacturer requirements, this study provides a novel framework for dynamic requirement elicitation and forecasting of smart PSS based on multi-source data. It contributes to facilitating the value co-creation during smart PSS development to optimize manufacturer's R&D &D resource allocation and enhance user experience.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0360-8352	1879-0550										Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Management, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Maritime Univ, China Inst FTZ Supply Chain, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R ChinaZhengzhou Univ, Sch Informat Management, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R ChinaZhengzhou Res Ctr Data Sci, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R ChinaShanghai Maritime Univ, Logist Engn Coll, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Dept Informat Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R ChinaTsinghua Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China	Zhengzhou Res Ctr Data Sci			2024-09-25	WOS:001316293600001

Chiu developed a two-step minimization procedure to obtain the three control variables, namely, the sampling interval, the sample size and the acceptance number. Although Chiu's two-step minimization procedure is simple, applicable and down to earth, it is rather inefficient and has some drawbacks. This paper presents an algorithm to overcome these drawbacks. The results and the execution times of all numerical examples show that the accuracy and the efficiency of the algorithm is reasonably good.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0160-5682															1995-11-01	WOS:A1995TB76900008

It is based on a deep learning framework with a large deep neural network (DNN) consisting of subnets designed from different perspectives. Multiple knowledge sources are then reasonably integrated via an early fusion of normalized noisy features with multiple beamforming techniques, enhanced speech features, speaker-related features, and other auxiliary features concatenated as the input to each sub net to compensate for imperfect front-end processing. Furthermore, a late fusion strategy is utilized to leverage the complementary natures of the different subnets by combining the outputs of all subnets to produce a single output set. Testing on the CHiME-3 task of recognizing microphone array speech, we demonstrate in our empirical study that the different information sources complement each other and that both early and late fusions provide significant performance gains, with an overall word error rate of 10.55% when combining 12 systems. Furthermore, by utilizing an improved technique for beamforming and a powerful recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model for restoring, a WER of 9.08% can be achieved for the best single DNN system with one-pass decoding among all of the systems submitted to the CHiME-3 challenge.

J	Shao, Wen-Ze; Ge, Qi; Deng, Hai-Song; Wei, Zhi-Hui; Li, Hai-Bo										A Unified Optimization Perspective to Single/Multi-observation Blur-Kernel Estimation with Applications to Camera-Shake Deblurring and Nonparametric Blind Super-Resolution								JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION				54	2			216	239				10.1007/s10851-015-0598-4							Article	FEB 2016	2016	The nonparametric blur-kernel estimation, using either single image or multi-observation, has been intensively studied since Fergus et al.'s influential work (ACM Trans Graph 25:787-794, 2006). However, in the current literature there is always a gap between the two highly relevant problems; that is, single- and multi-shot blind deconvolutions are modeled and solved independently, lacking a unified optimization perspective. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the two problems and propose a rigorous and unified minimization function for single/multi-shot blur-kernel estimation by coupling the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) and variational Bayesian (VB) principles. The new function is depicted using a directed graphical model, where the sharp image and the inverse noise variance associated with each shot are treated as random variables, while each blur-kernel, in difference from existing VB methods, is just modeled as a deterministic parameter. Utilizing a universal, three-level hierarchical prior on the latent sharp image and a Gamma hyper-prior on each inverse noise variance, single/multi-shot blur-kernel estimation is uniformly formulated as an -norm-regularized negative log-marginal-likelihood minimization problem. By borrowing ideas of expectation-maximization, majorization-minimization, and mean field approximation, as well as iteratively reweighted least squares, all the unknowns of interest, including the sharp image, the blur-kernels, the inverse noise variances, as well as other relevant parameters are estimated automatically. Compared with most single/multi-shot blur-kernel estimation methods, the proposed approach is not only more flexible in processing multiple observations under distinct imaging scenarios due to its independence of the commutative property of convolution but also more adaptive in sparse image modeling while in the meanwhile with much less implementational heuristics. Finally, the proposed blur-kernel estimation method is naturally applied to two low-level vision problems, i.e., camera-shake deblurring and nonparametric blind super-resolution. Experiments on benchmark real-world motion blurred images, simulated multiple-blurred images, as well as both synthetic and realistic low-resolution blurred images are conducted, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach to state-of-the-art single/multi-shot camera-shake deblurring and nonparametric blind super-resolution methods.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0924-9907	1573-7683										Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Coll Telecommun & Informat Engn, Nanjing 210003, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaTechnion Israel Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, IL-32000 Haifa, IsraelNanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Jiangsu Key Lab Image & Video Understanding Socia, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Audit Univ, Sch Sci, Nanjing 211815, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2016-03-02	WOS:000370146200006

Policies and practices are consequently necessary to support a just transition towards a low-carbon economy. Therefore, this study aimed to understand multi-actor perspectives on policies and practices relevant to the just transition in biofuel development. Applying a socio-legal approach based on the JUST framework, this study focused on the Indonesian biofuel industry, which is primarily driven by crude palm oil (CPO) production. This study also added comparative perspectives from Thailand's biofuel industry. The primary data were gathered from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs), while the secondary data were from research, policy, and other government archives. Based on the results, oil palm plantations in Indonesia and Thailand are crucial for macroeconomic development. However, smallholder farmers in Indonesia, especially independent ones that do not join farmer groups, remain marginalised by the current regulations. In fact, many benefits from biofuel practices and policies accumulate disproportionately towards large corporations, while marginalised groups bear the costs. The Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification that should induce market accessibility and competitiveness has not fully reached most rural farmers. Furthermore, various overlapping regulations and perplexing data differences exist from multiple ministries and administrative levels. Thus, palm oil stakeholders in Indonesia demand a dedicated institution for integrated regulation and monitoring of the industry, similar to the National Palm Oil Policy Committee in Thailand. The myriad of legal, political, socio-economic, and justice issues thus necessitates all hands on deck to ensure a just transition for all stakeholders of the Indonesian biofuel industry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073										Univ Brawijaya UB, Fac Law, Malang 65145, IndonesiaRobert Gordon Univ RGU, Aberdeen Business Sch, Aberdeen AB10 7QE, ScotlandKyoto Univ, Dept Global Ecol, Kyoto 6068501, JapanKyoto Univ, Div Environm Sci & Technol, Kyoto 6068502, Japan	Univ Brawijaya UB			2024-01-25	WOS:001139314600001

The program was designed to capitalize on the benefits of collaborative teaching, allowing students to differentiate their learning and access subject matter experts at multiple institutions, while enrolled in a single course at their home institution, through a framework of reciprocity. Although the CUAHSI Virtual University was developed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the resilience of its online education model to such disruptions to classroom teaching increases the urgency of understanding how effective such an approach is at achieving its goals and what challenges multi-institutional graduate training faces for sustainability and expansion within the water sciences or in other disciplines. To gain faculty perspectives on the program, we surveyed (1) water science graduate program faculty who had served as instructors in the program, (2) water science graduate program faculty who were aware of the program, but had not participated, and (3) departmental chairs of participating instructors. Our data show widespread agreement across respondent types that the program is positive for students, diversifying their educational opportunities and increasing access to subject matter experts. Concerns and factors limiting faculty involvement revolved around faculty workload and administrative barriers, including low enrollment at individual institutions. If these barriers can be surmounted, the CUAHSI Virtual University has the potential for wider participation within hydrology and adoption in other STEM disciplines.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2624-9375										Kent State Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Kent, OH 44240 USAUniv Wisconsin, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Madison, WI 53706 USAConsortium Univ Adv Hydrol Sci Inc, Arlington, MA USA	Consortium Univ Adv Hydrol Sci Inc			2022-11-02	WOS:000873751900001

The production process is distributed globally, and the pollution haven effect of international trade is becoming more complicated. For instance, intermediate product trade corresponds to the largest share of embodied emissions, and the share of emissions induced by the global value chain related trade is increasing gradually. The aim of this paper is to make a comprehensive analysis on the pollution haven hypothesis in carbon emissions embodied in three different trade patterns from global, bilateral, and national perspectives. We propose a method to parcel the pollution haven hypothesis in a multi-regional input-output analysis and discuss the contribution of production fragmentation for global emissions. It is found that international production fragmentation generates global emissions savings. The intermediate product trade has a negative balance of avoided emissions. The final product trade becomes increasingly less environmentally effective during the period 1995-2009. There are significant differences in the environmental effects of different trade patterns for each country.

Current studies on constructing such GNNs are limited by the single receptive field, resulting in the modeling of spurious correlations in self -explainable GNNs. To address this issue, this paper introduces a GNN model with incorporated multi -granularity receptive fields, capturing causal correlations during the model construction and providing explanations alongside its predictions. Specifically, we employ closeness matrices with multiple structural orders to construct multigranularity receptive fields for the model. Subsequently, we design a model architecture with sliced channels to integrate representations learned from multiple receptive fields heuristically. Objective functions from a causal perspective are further designed to guide the optimization of the proposed model. Experiments conducted on five real -world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model. In terms of classification accuracy, compared to SOTA baseline, the proposed GNN achieves the improvement of 0.17%, 1.99%, 0.70%, 0.83%, and 0.78% on the real -world datasets MUTAG, PTC, PROTEINS, IMDBM, and IMDB-B, respectively. Compared to three self -explainable baselines, qualitative and quantitative studies are conducted on MUTAG, PTC, PROTEINS, IMDB-M, IMDB-B, and the synthetic dataset Spurious -Motif. Experimental results confirm that the proposed model can accurately identify the essential substructures, such as NO2 in the MUTAG dataset. Additionally, the proposed model assigns significant weights to the motif part and distinguishes it from the base part in the Spurious -Motif dataset, enhancing the accuracy of graph classification and the explanations of the predictions. The classifications along with explanations obtained with this approach align with human cognition and experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0306-4573	1873-5371										Chongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Chongqing Key Lab Computat Intelligence, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R ChinaChongqing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Key Lab Cyberspace Big Data Intelligent Secur, Minist Educ, Chongqing 400065, Peoples R China				2024-07-14	WOS:001262644100001

In order to capture the experience of living with a robot at home, a multi-perspective evaluation was conducted.Methods: Older adults (n = 10) were invited to execute an actual interaction scenario with the Care-O-bot VR robot in a home-like environment and were questioned about their experiences. Additionally, interviews were conducted with the elderly participants, informal carers (n = 7) and professional caregivers (n = 11).Results: Seniors showed to be more keen to accept the robot than their caregivers and relatives. However, the robot in its current form was found to be too limited and participants wished the robot could perform more complex tasks. In order to be acceptable a future robot should execute these complex tasks based on the personal preferences of the user which would require the robot to be flexible and extremely smart, comparable to the care that is delivered by a human carer.Conclusions: Developing the functional features to perform activities is not the only challenge in robot development that deserves the attention of robot developers. The development of social behaviour and skills should be addressed as well. This is possible adopting a person-centred design approach, which relies on validation activities with actual users in realistic environments, similar to those described in this paper.									67	1	0	0	2	0	69			1748-3107	1748-3115										Zuyd Univ Appl Sci, Res Ctr Technol Care, Heerlen, NetherlandsMaastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Maastricht, NetherlandsUniv Siena, Dept Social Polit Cognit Sci, Siena, ItalyEindhoven Univ Technol, Fac Ind Design, Dept Social Polit Cognit Sci, Eindhoven, NetherlandsUniv Hertfordshire, Sch Comp Sci, Adapt Syst Res Grp, Hatfield, Herts, England	Zuyd Univ Appl Sci			2018-12-28	WOS:000439595600013	28758532

The most effective quality assessment from the consumer perspective is still to be researched, yet the most common approach is oriented towards quantitative indicators. This study proposes to use a two-dimensional model that combines the widely accepted segmentation of ICTs with elements from the SERVQUAL quality model. This model, useful in multi-criteria decision-making situations, has been developed using the 2-tuple linguistic representation and fuzzy logic principles. This methodology prevents data loss during processing and provides relevant information through 16 indicators related to the quality of service. Besides, an expert-based mechanism is defined for the use of historical information extracted from completed surveys. As a practical case, this mechanism is applied to the historical information of a telecommunications company for assessing the quality of the service provided to its customers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional methods like random sample consensus (RANSAC) struggle with handling outliers because they treat all observations as equally important. A series of advanced deep learning methods have recently emerged, which use deep learning techniques to estimate the probability of each sample being selected, prioritizing higher confidence for observations that are closer to the ground truth model. However, optimizing solely based on proximity to the ground truth model does not guarantee higher-quality estimations. Meanwhile spatial relationships between the data points in the minimum sampled set also influence the accuracy of the final estimated model. To address these issues, we propose Spatial-Aware Net (SA-Net), a dual-branch neural network that integrates both confidence and spatial encodings. SA-Net employs a confidence distribution encoder to learn the confidence distribution and a spatial distribution encoder to capture spatial correlations between point features. By incorporating multi-perspective sampling, the minimum sample set can be selected based on different spatial distributions in the output of the neural network, and applying Chamfer Loss constraints, our approach improves model optimization and effectively mitigates suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-Net outperforms the state of the art across various real-world robust estimation tasks.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1999-4893										China Univ Geosci, Sch Comp Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China				2025-03-02	WOS:001429904400001

It is a mechanism to design, analyse and control manufacturing processes through on-line, in-line, at-line and off-line configurations for monitoring Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). PAT systems include a combination of reliable in-line sensors, spectroscopic instruments and Multivariate Statistical Methods (MSMs) to provide informative knowledge for quality assessment of powdered and granule products. Nevertheless, monitoring programs of advanced manufacturing processes based on PAT sys-tems typically provide large sets of data which are complex to interpret. The application of appropriate data-driven modelling techniques could assist in the interpretation of complex data matrices to better control of processes. Data fusion is a data-driven approach that could increase performance and robust-ness of models used for data interpretation to generate more accurate knowledge about process condi-tions and performance by merging related outputs collected from several instruments and considering synergies from multiple sources. This paper aims at presenting the current state of the art regarding the application of multi-sensors data fusion for powdered and granule manufacturing processes and making a critical review of recent progress and future possible perspectives in this field.

In this study, we seek to expand our understanding of media usage in organizations where there is a multiplicity of communication media available to employees. We use communication media repertoires as the lens through which we explore how media is used in the support of communication-based work performed by individuals in complex organizational settings. Data were collected in sales divisions at two large corporations in the information technology industry. We compared multiple media use within and between the two sales divisions, and identified similarities and differences in repertoires. Our findings suggest that use of repertoires is influenced by institutional conditions (e.g., incentives, trust, and physical proximity) and situational conditions (e.g., urgency, task, etc.), and by routine use of the media overtime. Based on the findings, we propose a frame work for investigating the use of multiple media in organizations through examination of communication media repertoires. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed.									176	0	0	0	1	0	200			0276-7783											Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60607 USAVirginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA				2007-06-01	WOS:000246728300004

The classical algorithm of Eilenberg [1]s exponential one. On the other hand, for the finite deterministic automata an analogous Aho - Hopcroft - Ullman [2] algorithm has "almost" linear time complexity. Such a big gap leads to the idea of the existence of an algorithm which is more faster than an exponential one. Hunt and Stearns [3] announced the existence of polynomial algorithm for the Z - Sigma* - automata of finite degree of ambiguity only. Tzeng [4] created O(n(4)) algorithm for the general case. Diekert [5] informed us Tzeng's algorithm can be implemented in O(n(3)) using traingular matrices. Any way, we propose a new O(n(3)) algorithm (for the general case). Our algorithm utilizes recent results of Siberian mathematical school (Gerasimov [6], Valitckas [7]) about the structure of rings and does not share common ideas with Eilenberg [1] and Tzeng [4].					6th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (DLT 2002)6th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (DLT 2002)	SEP 18-21, 2002SEP 18-21, 2002	Inoue Fdn Sci; Kayamori Sci Fdn; Asahi Glass Fdn; EATCSInoue Fdn Sci; Kayamori Sci Fdn; Asahi Glass Fdn; EATCS	KYOTO SANGYO UNIV, KYOTO, JAPANKYOTO SANGYO UNIV, KYOTO, JAPAN	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		3-540-40431-7									Kiev Natl Univ, Cybernet Dept, UA-04070 Kiev, Ukraine				2003-01-01	WOS:000185510600024

This procedure is based on the following principles: the interference is cancelled in linearly going ECG segments that have near to zero frequency content using moving averaging; the extracted samples are saved in a buffer and are then subtracted from the remaining parts of the signals. The accuracy of the subtraction procedure is analysed and improved in the cases of non-multiplicity between the sampling rate and the rated interference frequency. Extrapolation filters are applied over the buffer samples. Experiments with synthesised and real signals are carried out to assess the filter's stability. The results obtained show that the improved subtraction procedure removes the PL interference from ECG signals regardless of the type of multiplicity, odd or even, between the sampling rate and the power-line frequency.

A number of generic knowledge management cross sectional studies based on Chinese organizations have taken place; however there is a lack of in-depth critical studies which are culturally grounded and which focus on a particular aspect or domain of knowledge management in Chinese organizations, as opposed to applying western or Japanese knowledge management models and concepts. Hence the paper seeks to make a contribution by carrying out a critical study in knowledge sharing within Chinese organizations that explores the role of culture in relation to the knowledge-sharing process, where the people-based aspects of knowledge sharing are likely lobe influenced by the prevailing culture. The aim of the paper is to explore the role of knowledge sharing at multiple organizational levels within Chinese service-based organizations.Design/methodology/approach - Five consulting firms are analyzed within the multi case study, to explore knowledge sharing at multiple levels, where existing literature and preliminary research has shown that consulting organizations in the service sector are more likely to have advanced their understanding of knowledge sharing as a source of innovation and competitiveness. The research methods included interviews (n = 40), focus groups (n = 10) and observations made during four visits, each of several weeks, to the companies. The five organizations were Chinese owned and at a similar growth stage and hence the effects of external cultures or organizational specific cultures were secondary to that of the prevailing Chinese culture.Findings - The findings show that cultural interpretations of knowledge sharing practices can help in explaining Chinese conceptions and applications of knowledge sharing at multiple organizational levels. Moreover these cultural influences suggest that non-Chinese conceptions of knowledge sharing can in some circumstances result in misleading approaches being used in attempting to promote knowledge sharing in a Chinese context and that the strong group culture is a key vehicle for knowledge sharing as opposed to individual idea generation.Research limitations/implications - The findings show the need for further research in comparing Chinese and western organizations in relation to collaboration knowledge sharing where the case organizations have had different levels of exposure to western culture. Much more in-depth case-based research is needed to explore these contextual issues and to develop theoretical propositions.Practical implications - The extrapolation of western and Japanese-based knowledge sharing concepts and practices to Chinese contexts without an examination of Chinese culture and its impact on organizational culture may produce sub-optimal results. A more culturally grounded approach, where knowledge sharing practices are indigenously grounded, is suggested.Originality/value - There is a paucity of multi-level knowledge sharing studies which seek to both address cultural considerations and systematically inquire into the development of knowledge sharing in Chinese organizations from a cultural perspective. The findings from this study can help inform western-Chinese business collaboration through improved understanding of the cultural effects on knowledge sharing.									49	0	0	0	0	2	56			1367-3270	1758-7484										Univ Ulster, Ulster Business Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North IrelandUniv Ulster, Sch Intelligent Syst, Belfast, Antrim, North IrelandUniv Ulster, Sch Comp & Intelligent Syst, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland				2012-01-01	WOS:000302205100008

Binary and continuous multiplicity of MR are also defined in Part I, and relation is given there between structural redundancy and binary multiplicity.Based on this results, ideal and binarily minimal MR-s are defined, and the different MR-s are compared from numerical point of view in the present (and final) part. Ideal MR represents all the considered structures and not any other structure. Supposing the process graphs are distincted using binary variables, binarily minimal MR uses the minimal number of them.Solvability of the different MR-s, including some combined versions, are tested on a middle scale and an industrial scale process synthesis problems. Total solution time, solution time for subproblems, number of iterations, non-ideality and scale of the solvable problems are compared. Idealization of the representation and decreasing the number of binary variables, as suggested in the article, both enhance the solvability and decrease the solution time in a great extent.

The system is based on 250 MHz 12-bit digitizers, and is triggered by a user chosen multiplicity of Compton suppressed detectors. The logic for trigger generation is similar to the one practised for analog (NIM/CAMAC) pulse processing electronics, while retaining the fast processing merits of the digitizer system. Codes for reduction of data acquired from the system have also been developed. The system has been tested with offline studies using radioactive sources as well as in the in-beam experiments with an array of Compton suppressed Clover detectors. The results obtained therefrom validate its use in spectroscopic efforts for nuclear structure investigations.									36	3	0	0	0	0	38			0168-9002	1872-9576										UGC DAE Consortium Sci Res, Kolkata Ctr, Kolkata 700098, IndiaUGC DAE Consortium Sci Res, Indore 452001, Madhya Pradesh, IndiaVariable Energy Cyclotron Ctr, Phys Grp, Kolkata 700064, IndiaHomi Bhaba Natl Inst, Training Sch Complex, Bombay 400094, Maharashtra, IndiaSaha Inst Nucl Phys, Nucl Phys Div, Kolkata 700064, IndiaTata Inst Fundamental Res, Dept Nucl & Atom Phys, Bombay 400005, Maharashtra, IndiaXIA LLC, Hayward, CA 94544 USA	XIA LLC			2018-04-30	WOS:000430167800017

Schools and universities are thus increasing their efforts to leverage educational resources and provide possibilities for remote learning. A variety of educational programs, platforms, and technologies are now accessible to support student learning; while these tools are important for society, they are primarily concerned with the dissemination of theoretical material. There is a lack of support for hands-on laboratory work and practical experience. This is particularly important for all disciplines related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), where labs and pedagogical assets must be continuously enhanced in order to provide effective study programs. In this study, we describe a unique perspective to achieving multi-sensory learning through the integration of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) with haptic wearables in STEM education. We address the implications of a novel viewpoint on established pedagogical notions. We want to encourage worldwide efforts to make fully immersive, open, and remote laboratory learning a reality.									44	0	0	0	2	0	45				2218-6581										Univ Agder UiA, Dept Engn Sci, N-4879 Grimstad, NorwayKaunas Univ Technol, Fac Informat, Studentu Str 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, LithuaniaUniv Siena, Dept Informat Engn & Math, I-53100 Siena, ItalyUniv Minho, Dept Informat Syst, R Univ, P-4710057 Braga, PortugalPolitehn Univ Timisoara, Multimedia Res Ctr, Timisoara 300006, RomaniaUniv Agder UiA, Dept Informat Syst, N-4630 Kristiansand, Norway				2022-05-03	WOS:000785339400001

EXIN networks self-organize in complex perceptual environments, in the presence of multiple superimposed patterns, multiple scales, and uncertainty, The networks use a new inhibitory learning rule, in addition to an excitatory learning rule, to allow superposition of multiple simultaneous neural activations ( multiple winners), under strictly regulated circumstances, instead of forcing winner-take-all pattern classifications. The multiple activations represent uncertainty or multiplicity in perception and pattern recognition. Perceptual scission (breaking of linkages) between independent category groupings thus arises and allows effective global context-sensitive segmentation, constraint satisfaction and exclusive credit attribution. A Weber Law neuron growth rule lets the network learn and classify input patterns despite variations in their spatial scale, Applications of the new techniques include segmentation of superimposed auditory or biosonar signals, segmentation of visual regions, and representation of visual transparency.									25	0	0	0	2	0	26			0893-6080															1995-01-01	WOS:A1995QV18300001

ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY				27	1					4			10.1007/s10676-024-09812-3							Article	MAR 2025	2025	Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) have become the new buzzword for researchers, planners, policymakers, and industry experts when it comes to designing, planning, and managing sustainable and efficient cities. It encapsulates the last iteration of the technocratic and ultra-efficient, post-modernist vision of smart cities. However, while more applications branded as UDTs appear around the world, its conceptualization remains ambiguous. Beyond being technically prescriptive about what UDTs are, this article focuses on their aspects of interaction and operationalization in connection to people in cities, and how enhanced by metaverse ideas they can deepen societal divides by offering divergent urban experiences based on different stakeholder preferences. Therefore, firstly this article repositions the term UDTs by comparing existing concrete and located applications that have a focus on interaction and participation, including some that may be closer to the concept of UDT than is commonly assumed. Based on the components found separately in the different studied cases, it is possible to hypothesize about possible future, more advanced realizations of UDTs. This enables us to contrast their positive and negative societal impacts. While the development of new immersive interactive digital worlds can improve planning using collective knowledge for more inclusive and diverse cities, they pose significant risks not only the common ones regarding privacy, transparency, or fairness, but also social fragmentation based on urban digital multiplicities. The potential benefits and challenges of integrating this multiplicity of UDTs into participatory urban governance emphasize the need for human-centric approaches to promote socio-technical frameworks able to mitigate risks as social division.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-1957	1572-8439										Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Computat Social Sci, D GESS, Stampfenbachstr 48, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland				2024-11-28	WOS:001361227600001	39583937

We consider the high-multiplicity version of the problem, in which there are only C different weight values. We show that when C=2 the problem can be solved in time O( log D). For the general case, we give an algorithm which provides a solution requiring at most C-2 bins more than the optimal solution, i.e., an algorithm that is asymptotically exact. For fixed C, the complexity of the algorithm is O(poly( log D)), where poly(center dot) is a polynomial function not depending on C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	9			0025-5610	1436-4646										Univ Padua, Dept Pure & Appl Math, I-35131 Padua, ItalyUniv Siena, Dept Informat Engn, I-53100 Siena, Italy				2005-09-01	WOS:000231421600002

Two cruces here lie in counterintuitive or conservative nature of semantic descriptors for ITSs, and disregard for multiplicity of causalities resulting from uncertainty in causalities between data or between trends within a set of interval-valued data. In this paper, we put forth a type of joint interval-trend fuzzy information granules, which takes non-loss of within-interval information as the main design criterion. A modified fuzzy information granulation method carries originality in portraying intuitive and accurate interval-trends, directly linked with inherent relational constraints such as lower bound data should not be greater than upper bound data. Furthermore, we formulate a legible format of multi-factor fuzzy IF-THEN rules, which exhibits interesting interpretations to causalities between interval-trends at a higher level of multiplicity. The forecasting process is fuzzy rules-based, resulting in wise results by calculating rule firing weights. Thus, we develop a well construct of accuracy and interpretability for multi-step forecasting of ITSs, manifested in: (a) reducing cumulative errors by operating at the granular level, and (b) perceiving interval-trends in an intelligible manner and emphasizing multiple causalities via transparent fuzzy logic inference. Experimental results convincingly confirm the validity of the model.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-0255	1872-6291										Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Key Lab Math & Complex Syst, Minist Educ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Normal Univ, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China				2025-01-11	WOS:001382558900001		
J	Maushagen, Cynthia; Rothe, Joerg										Complexity of control by partitioning veto elections and of control by adding candidates to plurality elections								ANNALS OF MATHEMATICS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				82	4	SI		219	244				10.1007/s10472-017-9565-7							Article	APR 2018	2018	Control by partition refers to situations where an election chair seeks to influence the outcome of an election by partitioning either the candidates or the voters into two groups, thus creating two first-round subelections that determine who will take part in a final round. The model of partition-of-voters control attacks is remotely related to "gerrymandering" (maliciously resizing election districts). While the complexity of control by partition has been studied thoroughly for many voting systems, there are no such results known for the important veto voting system. We settle the complexity of control by partition for veto in a broad variety of models. In addition, by giving a counterexample we observe that a reduction from the literature (Chen et al. 2015) showing the parameterized complexity of control by adding candidates to plurality elections, parameterized by the number of voters, is technically flawed, and we show how this reduction can be adapted to make it correct.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1012-2443	1573-7470										Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Inst Informat, Univ Str 1, Dusseldorf, Germany				2018-06-12	WOS:000433548900003

A hybrid sequential niche algorithm for optimal engineering design with solution multiplicity								COMPUTERS & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				33	7			1261	1271				10.1016/j.compchemeng.2009.02.006							Article	JUL 15 2009	2009	This paper introduces a new hybrid algorithm for locating all solutions in multimodal optimization problems. This algorithm combines an adaptive sequential niche technique with deterministic local optimization to detect all extrema efficiently and reliably. Agenetic element of the hybrid algorithm performs a global search while the deterministic local optimizer computes the precise coordinates of the extremum. Once an extremum is precisely located, a niche demarcating the area of attraction around the local minimum is recorded. The sequential process proceeds to search for additional extrema. Our novel method overcomes challenges to distinguish multiple extrema in problem-specific terrain by an automatic niche radius adjustment. Several comparative simulation experiments with previous niche algorithms demonstrate the novel algorithm's performance and reliability. We also present a difficult case study for solution multiplicity in catalytic pellets. We determine multiple solutions for distributed inversion problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, a sphere-shaped SVM for multiclass problems is presented. Compared with the classical plane-shaped SVMs, the number of convex quadratic programming problems and the number of variables in each programming are smaller. Such SVM classifier is applied to the electroencephalogram (EEG) source localization problem, and the multiplicity of source models is determined according to the potentials recorded on the scalp. Experimental results indicate that the sphere-shaped SVM based classifier is an effective and promising approach for this task.					11th IEEE Biennial Conference on Electromagnetic Field Computation11th IEEE Biennial Conference on Electromagnetic Field Computation	JUN 06-09, 2004JUN 06-09, 2004	IEEE Magnet Soc; Seoul Natl UnivIEEE Magnet Soc; Seoul Natl Univ	Seoul, SOUTH KOREASeoul, SOUTH KOREA	12	5	0	0	0	0	17			0018-9464											Hebei Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R ChinaHebei Univ Technol, Prov Minist Joint Key Lab Electromagnet Fiels & E, Tianjin 300130, Peoples R China				2005-05-01	WOS:000229084200140

In doing so, miniplant-scale experimental data were utilized to scale-up, predict and represent the performance of the unit operations in the industrial-scale operation of a reference stand-alone and two different integrated OCM process configuration, each with an assumed capacity of one million tons per year ethylene production. Technical, environmental and economic performance of these alternative OCM processes were analyzed and compared using Aspen Plus simulations and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The assumptions and the conceptual conclusions made in the analysis are also discussed in this paper. The technologies and the costs associated with conditioning the methane feed stream originated from natural gas or biogas were compared and their impacts, through reducing the resulted price of methane-feed, on the economy of the OCM process are discussed. Moreover, the integration potentials of the OCM process with the ethane dehydrogenation process and the clear impacts of the resulted increase in the ethylene production on the whole process economy are also considered in this paper. The feasibility and the specifications of the selected integrated OCM process configuration, providing the fastest return of investments around 9.5 year, are discussed in this paper. The economic and environmental performance indicators of this integrated process along with the potentials and some suggestions for further improving its performance are also highlighted in this paper.

This article examines the interaction mechanisms between green finance (GF) and clean energy (CE), constructs both single-layer correlation networks and multi-layer networks (MN) based on panel data from 30 provinces in China spanning from 2007 to 2022, analyzes the characteristics of multi-layer network nodes and structures, and identifies main driving factors by using geographical detector. The findings reveal that the correlation degree of China's GF, CE, and their synergistic development (SD) network has shown a continuous improvement trend. Compared to single-layer networks, the network structure and related attributes of MN exhibit more optimized performance. With the integrated development of each layer network, four primary communities emerge within the MN: the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) community, the Northeast community, the North China community, and the Central- Western community. Factors such as economy, population, and society influence SDGC correlation network patterns to varying degrees, and the influence of interactions among these factors is even more prominent. Therefore, each province should clarify its role within the network and promote SDGC from the dual perspectives of fostering its own and overall development.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0960-1481	1879-0682										Guizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Coll Big Data Applicat & Econ, Guiyang Coll Big Data Finance, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R ChinaGuizhou Collaborat Innovat Ctr Green Finance & Eco, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R ChinaGuizhou Univ Finance & Econ, Artificial Intelligence & Digital Finance Lab, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R ChinaUniv Lancaster, Dept Mkt, Management Sch, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England	Guizhou Collaborat Innovat Ctr Green Finance & Eco			2025-01-17	WOS:001394629500001

Algorithms for relaxations of work-stealing have been proposed, which only partially avoid this impossibility result. In restricted models of computation, work-stealing algorithms have been designed that avoid Read-After-Write patterns and atomic Read-Modify-Write instructions. This paper considers work-stealing with multiplicity, a relaxation in which every task is taken by at least one process, and any process can take any task at most once. We study two variants of the relaxation, for each variant designing a Read/Write wait-free algorithm in the standard asynchronous shared memory model. The two algorithms are devoid of Read-After-Write synchronization patterns in all their operations, and additionally, the algorithm for the second variant has constant step complexity and is fence-free. Namely, no specific ordering among the algorithm's instructions is required beyond what is implied by data dependence. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms for relaxations of work-stealing possessing all these properties. The algorithms are also solutions to relaxed versions of single-enqueuer multi-dequeuer queues. The theoretical results are complemented with an experimental evaluation showing that the benefits of relaxed work-stealing vary depending on the application, concretely on the complexity of the work associated with each task.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0743-7315	1096-0848										Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Matemat, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, MexicoUniv Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Programa Doctorado Ciencia & Ingn Comp, Ciudad Univ, Mexico City 04510, Mexico				2024-01-27	WOS:001147141800001

Backdoor attacks involve embedding a hidden backdoor into a DNN model, compelling it to correctly classify benign images while erroneously classifying images with backdoor triggers as the target label. However, both current backdoor attacks and defenses have their limitations. In backdoor attacks, they are either non-stealthy or vulnerable to well-designed backdoor defense strategies. As for backdoor defenses, they often rely heavily on additional assumptions (such as determined extra clean images) and are not universally applicable, which may become impractical in the face of the latest backdoor attacks. To address the above problems, in this paper, we investigate the backdoor attack and defense strategies from a multi-channel perspective. Specifically, in terms of attacks, we propose a recolorization based attack method (RC-Attack) to generate triggers in color ab channels, which is more stealthy and effective. In terms of defenses, we propose a reconstruction-based defense method (RC-Defense) to reconstruct the color AB channels and lightness channel respectively, thus making the triggers in the reconstructed images ineffective, which is a more practical solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed RC-Attack in terms of effectiveness, stealthiness and defense-resistance, and also to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RC-Defense.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1556-6013	1556-6021										China Univ Petr East China, Coll Control Sci & Engn, Qingdao 266580, Peoples R ChinaHunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R ChinaEast China Jiaotong Univ, Coll Informat Engn, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R ChinaQilu Univ Technol, Shandong Comp Sci Ctr, Key Lab Comp Power Network & Informat Secur, Minist Educ,Shandong Acad Sci, Jinan 250353, Peoples R China				2024-09-10	WOS:001273082400008		
J	Ding, Zhikun; Sun, Zihuan; Xu, Xiaoxiao										An automatic flood escape route identification method for existing underground spaces: From the perspective of multi-objective trade-offs								COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				204						111082			10.1016/j.cie.2025.111082					APR 2025		Article	JUN 2025	2025	Frequent occurrences of flood disasters pose a significant threat to the safety of urban residents. Although research on emergency management for building disasters has made progress, it has primarily focused on fire incidents, lacking comprehensive studies on flood disasters. Furthermore, existing studies on optimal escape route planning predominantly relied on single criteria, resulting in a limited evaluation perspective. To address this gap, this research introduces a dynamic, systematic, and versatile framework for optimizing escape routes in flood scenarios, which incorporates Building Information Modeling (BIM), flood fluid simulation, crowd evacuation simulation, and weighted multi-criteria evaluation. The effectiveness and superiority of the framework are demonstrated through a case study of an underground facility used for university teaching and research. The outcomes of this research contribute to bridging the theoretical gap in emergency management of underground spaces during flood disasters, providing valuable insights to enhance the emergency preparedness of buildings in flood-prone areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-8352	1879-0550										Shenzhen Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Coastal Urban Resilient Infrastructures, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaGuangdong Lab Artificial Intelligence & Digital Ec, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaShenzhen Univ, Sino Australia Joint Res Ctr BIM & Smart Construct, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaUniv Shenzhen, Shenzhen Key Lab Green, Efficient & Intelligent Construct Underground Metr, Shenzhen, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Forestry Univ, Sch Civil Engn, 159 Longpan Rd, Nanjing 210037, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2025-04-18	WOS:001463546200001

For instance, the use of a phylogenetic tree can aid in the inference of orthology and paralogy relationships, and in the detection of relevant evolutionary events such as gene family expansions and contractions, horizontal gene transfer, recombination or incomplete lineage sorting. Similarly, given the plurality of evolutionary histories among genes encoded in a given genome, there is a need for the combined analysis of genome-wide collections of phylogenetic trees (phylomes). Here, we introduce a new release of PhylomeDB (http://phylomedb.org), a public repository of phylomes. Currently, PhylomeDB hosts 120 public phylomes, comprising >1.5 million maximum likelihood trees and multiple sequence alignments. In the current release, phylogenetic trees are annotated with taxonomic, protein-domain arrangement, functional and evolutionary information. PhylomeDB is also a major source for phylogeny-based predictions of orthology and paralogy, covering >10 million proteins across 1059 sequenced species. Here we describe newly implemented PhylomeDB features, and discuss a benchmark of the orthology predictions provided by the database, the impact of proteome updates and the use of the phylome approach in the analysis of newly sequenced genomes and transcriptomes.									170	0	0	0	161	0	185			0305-1048	1362-4962										Ctr Genom Regulat, Bioinformat & Genom Programme, Barcelona 08003, SpainUniv Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, SpainInst Catalana Recerca & Estudis Avancats, Barcelona 08010, Spain				2014-01-01	WOS:000331139800131	24275491

Otherwise, in order to derive a symmetric pure real distribution from the canonical pattern synthesis techniques, a generation of a pure-real pattern has to be imposed. In the present work, the exploitation of the multiplicity of the shaped pattern generated by this symmetric pure real distribution is proposed, without constraining the solutions to necessarily meet the pure-real pattern requirement. Therefore, an increase on the degrees of freedom is produced and a greater number of continuous distributions (presenting different natures) is achieved, by omitting the restrictions found in the state-of-the-art methodologies. Thus, a general multiplicity of solutions can be reached and the design protocol can increase its number of alternatives for facing different feeding network structures. In such a way, this article is devoted to illustrate the improvements in terms of number of feasible solutions reached by the general method, including alternative symmetric pure real distributions as input within the procedure. In this manner, two different approaches, constraining the pattern to present the same number of ripples or a similar main beam width, are discussed. Examples of both Taylor distributions linear and circular are illustrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536											Univ Trento, DISI, ELEDIA UniTN, I-38123 Trento, ItalyUniv Santiago de Compostela, CRETUS Inst, Dept Appl Phys, Santiago De Compostela 15782, SpainUniv Santiago de Compostela, CRETUS Inst, Dept Morphol, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain				2021-02-10	WOS:000611802300001

However, in the absence of explicit guidelines for how to use QCA for theory development, the popularity and proliferation of QCA possibly amplifies the risk of using QCA in an atheoretical manner, hindering theoretical advancement. In this paper, we offer a conceptual framework and prescriptive guidelines for applying QCA to develop causal recipes that account for complex digital phenomena marked by theoretical and configurational multiplicity. Causal recipes are formal statements explaining how causally relevant elements combine into configurations associated with outcomes of interest. We describe these causal recipes in terms of which causes matter (i.e., factorial logic) and how these causes combine into configurations (i.e., combinatorial logic) to produce target outcomes, and propose an ecology of configurations that elucidates the explanatory power of multiple configurations as well as their explanatory overlap. Further, we offer two illustrative empirical examples to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework and step-by-step guidelines for applying QCA to deductive theory testing as well as inductive theory development on phenomena marked by multiplicity.									196	3	0	0	8	1	199			0276-7783											George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Informat Syst & Technol Management, Washington, DC 20052 USAUniv Southern Calif, Marshall Sch Business, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA				2020-12-01	WOS:000596039600002

This problem models the situation where an additional resource, subject to unavailability constraints, is required to start and to finish a job. We consider in this paper the high-multiplicity version of the problem, when the input is given using a compact encoding. We present a polynomial time algorithm for large diversity instances (when the number of different processing times is greater than the number of forbidden instants). We also show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable when the number of forbidden instants is fixed, regardless of jobs characteristics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1094-6136	1099-1425										Univ Grenoble Alpes, G SCOP, F-38000 Grenoble, FranceCNRS, G SCOP, F-38000 Grenoble, FranceUniv Lorraine, Lab LGIPM, Ile Saulcy, F-57045 Metz, France				2016-10-26	WOS:000383661100007

Sustainable product design uses multi-criteria decision methods to select the best material or process from a set of alternatives, requiring that the target product is already known. This paper follows a contrary approach by introducing the Multi-Perspective Application Selection, a method to support researchers and industrial practitioners alike in identifying and choosing the most promising and sustainable applications for new materials under development. This is achieved through combining and assessing technical, economic and environmental criteria covering the entire life cycle of an application. With this method, numerous possible applications can be screened during the early stages of material development when little information is available. The results help to narrow the selection of feasible products by excluding unpromising applications. The first step involves identifying and segmenting potential markets. In the second step, technical and economic aspects are assessed by employing user acceptance criteria. Finally, simplified life cycle assessment calculations are implemented in the third step to cover environmental considerations. Using an example of cellulose nanofiber reinforced composites, the authors illustrate the procedure whereby luxury consumer goods, specialty vehicles, industrial processing and furniture result as the most promising applications identified from this new method.

J	Saif, Eiad; Eminoglu, Ilyas				Saif, Eiad/AAK-4944-2021						Hybrid Power Systems in Multi-Rotor UAVs: A Scientific Research and Industrial Production Perspective								IEEE ACCESS				11				438	458				10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3232958							Article	2023	2023	This study is conducted in the context of two significant challenges facing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies. These challenges are limited flight duration and payload, which have a direct impact on the performance and areas of application. The Hybrid Power System (HPS) has a prominent role in overcoming these challenges with a view to expanding the application fields of UAVs to include further areas such as air taxis and air ambulance services. This work first presents a systematic review of the scientific contributions in the past two decades with the aim of exploring the existing design approaches for HPSs in multi-rotor UAVs. To do this, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been done. The selected articles have been reviewed, analyzed, evaluated, and then classified according to the scope of the study, research trends, design methodologies, main findings/shortcomings, and future work. Retrieved data shows that the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller were most commonly used. Fuel Cells (FCs) still need more research and experiments to overcome practical constraints, while solar-powered UAVs require more surface areas to absorb large amounts of solar radiation. To keep up-to-date with technological advances in this area, this research also surveys, analyzes, and discusses the available commercial models of HPS that can be used in UAVs along with some examples of hybrid-powered UAVs. The intended goal of this paper is to stimulate and help researchers and those interested in the challenges of electric UAVs and guide them to develop this field more efficiently from an industrial/scientific perspective.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2169-3536											Sanaa Community Coll, Dept Comp & Elect Engn, Sanaa, YemenOndokuz Mayis Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-55139 Samsun, Turkiye	Sanaa Community Coll			2023-01-25	WOS:000907948000001

There are edges of three types: ordinary edges, multiple edges, and multi-edges. Each edge of the last two types is a union of k linked edges, which connect 2 or (k + 1) vertices correspondingly. The linked edges should be used simultaneously. If a vertex is incident to a multiple edge, it can be also incident to other multiple edges and it can be the common end of k linked edges of some multi-edge. If a vertex is the common end of some multi-edge, it cannot be the common edge of another multi-edge. A multiple tree is a connected multiple graph with no cycles. Unlike ordinary trees, the number of edges in a multiple tree is not fixed. The problem of finding the spanning tree can be set for a multiple graph. Complete spanning trees form a special class of spanning trees of a multiple graph. Their peculiarity is that a multiple path joining any two selected vertices exists in the tree if and only if such a path exists in the initial graph. If the multiple graph is weighted, the minimum spanning tree problem and the minimum complete spanning tree problem can be set. As well, it is possible to formulate the problems of recognition of the spanning tree and complete spanning tree of the limited weight. The main result of this article is the proof of NP-completeness of such recognition problems for arbitrary multiple graphs as well as for divisible multiple graphs in the case when multiplicity k >= 3. The corresponding optimization problems are NP-hard.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0146-4116	1558-108X										Demidov Yaroslavl State Univ, Yaroslavl 150003, Russia				2023-03-10	WOS:000936422500016

Based on this numeric semantics we check the satisfiability and consistency of class diagrams and compute minimal models. We show that this approach is efficient and provides succinct user feedback in the case of errors. In an experimental section we demonstrate that general off-the-shelf solvers for integer linear programming perform as well on real-world and synthetic benchmarks as specialised algorithms do, facilitating the extension of the formal model by further numeric constraints like cost functions. Our results are embedded in a research programme on reasoning about class diagrams and are motivated by applications in configuration management. Compared to other (for instance logic-based) approaches our aim is to hide the complexity of formal methods behind familiar user interfaces like class diagrams and to concentrate on problems that can be solved efficiently in order to be able to provide immediate feedback to users.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1619-1366	1619-1374										Vienna Univ Technol, A-1060 Vienna, Austria				2014-07-30	WOS:000338502600013

We introduce preconditioners to nonlinear equations or a system of nonlinear equations and their corresponding Jacobians. The inclusion of preconditioners provides numerical stability and accuracy. The different selection of preconditioner offers a family of iterative methods. We modified an existing method in a way that we do not alter its inherited quadratic convergence. Numerical simulations confirm the quadratic convergence of the preconditioned iterative method. The influence of preconditioners is clearly reflected in the numerically achieved accuracy of computed solutions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1999-4893										Univ Insubria, Dipartimento Sci & Alta Tecnol, Via Valleggio 11, I-22100 Como, ItalyUniv Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis & Engn Nucl, Eduard Maristanu 10, Barcelona 08019, SpainUCERD Pvt Ltd, Islamabad 44000, PakistanUniv Gujrat, Dept Comp Sci, Gujrat 50700, PakistanKing Abdulaziz Univ, Dept Math, Jeddah 21589, Saudi ArabiaTech Univ Catalonia, Heat & Mass Transfer Technol Ctr, Colom 11, Terrassa 08222, SpainGovt Coll Univ Lahore, Dept Math, Lahore 54000, Pakistan	UCERD Pvt Ltd			2017-04-26	WOS:000398723600016

However, clean energy supplies in multi-energy building districts are still at the preliminary stages for energy paradigm transitions. In particular, technologies and methodologies for large-scale renewable energy integrations are still not sufficiently sophisticated, in terms of intelligent control management. Artificial intelligent (AI) techniques powered renewable energy systems can learn from bio-inspired lessons and provide power systems with intelligence. However, there are few in-depth dissections and deliberations on the roles of AI techniques for large-scale integrations of renewable energy and decarbon-isation in multi-energy systems. This study summarizes the commonly used AI-related approaches and discusses their functional advantages when being applied in various renewable energy sectors, as well as their functional contribution to optimizing the operational control modalities of renewable energy and improving the overall operational effectiveness. This study also presents practical applications of various AI techniques in large-scale renewable energy integration systems, and analyzes their effectiveness through theoretical explanations and diverse case studies. In addition, this study introduces limitations and challenges associated with the large-scale renewable energy integrations for carbon neutrality transition using relevant AI techniques, and proposes further promising research perspectives and recommendations. This comprehensive review ignites advanced AI tech-niques for large-scale renewable integrations and provides valuable informational instructions and guidelines to different stakeholders (e.g., engineers, designers and scientists) for carbon neutrality transition.									107	1	0	0	4	0	107			2666-5468											Hunan Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Natl Ctr Int Res Collaborat Bldg Safety & Environm, Changsha 410082, Peoples R ChinaDelft Univ Technol, Fac Architecture & Built Environm, Julianalaan 134, NL-2628 BL Delft, NetherlandsConcordia Univ, Dept Bldg Civil & Environm Engn, Energy & Environm Grp, Montreal, PQ, CanadaGuangzhou Univ, Coll Civil Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Bldg Environm & Energy Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Univ, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Bldg Energy Efficiency & Ap, Guangzhou, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Univ Sci & Technol Guangzhou, Sustainable Energy & Environm Thrust, Funct Hub, Nansha 511400, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaHKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In, Shenzhen, Peoples R China	HKUST Shenzhen Hong Kong Collaborat Innovat Res In			2023-09-25	WOS:001062456100001

This study considers the coupling of "space of flows" and "spaces of places" as the core and "embeddedness" as the link and a relevant theoretical basis; then we construct a conceptual model of urban networks and explore the internal logic of enterprise networks and city networks. Using the interlocking-affiliate network model and data from China's top 500 listed companies, this study constructs a directed multi-valued relational matrix between cities in western China from 2005 to 2015. Using social network analysis and the multiple regression of quadratic assignment program model (MRQAP), this study adopts a "top-down" research perspective to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution and growth mechanism of the city network in western China from three nested spatial scales: large regions, intercity agglomerations, and intracity agglomerations. The results show the following: (1) Under the large regional scale, the city network has good symmetry, obvious characteristics of hierarchical diffusion, neighborhood diffusion, and cross-administrative regional connection, presenting the "core-periphery" structural pattern. (2) The network of intercity agglomerations has the characteristics of centralization, stratification, and geographical proximity. (3) The internal network of each urban agglomeration presents a variety of network structure modes, such as dual-core, single-core, and multicore modes. (4) Administrative subordination and economic system proximity have a significant positive impact on the city network in western China. The differences in internet convenience, investment in science and technology, average time distance, and economic development have negative effects on the growth and development of city networks. (5) The preferential attachment is the internal driving force of the city network development.									27	5	0	0	2	0	28			1009-637X	1861-9568										Northwest Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R ChinaLanzhou Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China				2022-03-22	WOS:000764791300008		
J	Cui, LH; Cheng, ZX										A method of construction for biorthogonal multiwavelets system with 2r multiplicity								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				167	2			901	918				10.1016/j.amc.2004.06.116							Article	AUG 15 2005	2005	Biorthogonal multiwavelets systems are consisted of a pair of biorthogonal multiscaling functions and the corresponding a pair of multiwavelets. A method for constructing biorthogonal multiwavelets systems with multiplicity 2r was derived. In particular Hermite interpolation mask was considered as primal masks. A pair of primal and dual masks with high order of sum rules should be firstly designed in order to obtain a biorthogonal multiwavelet with high vanishing moment. Concretely, starting from a short sequence primal masks possessing Hermite interpolation properties, a necessary and sufficient conditions such that primal masks satisfies the preassigned order of sum rules are established, then a dual masks with short support, symmetry and any preassigned order of sum rules is constructed, it follows that two multiscaling functions are obtained and then multiwavelets and dual multiwavelets are derived. From which, a general design framework is obtained for constructing biorthogonal multiwavelets system with multiplicity 2r associated with Hermite interpolation functions. The biorthogonal multiwavelets constructed by our design framework has desirable properties such as symmetry, short support, high vanishing moments and simple structures with explicit expressions. Finally, an example is given. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Accurate state-of-health (SOH) estimation is critical for ensuring battery operational performance. Despite numerous data-driven methods reported in existing research for battery SOH estimation, these methods often exhibit inconsistent performance across different application scenarios. To address this issue and overcome the performance limitations of individual data-driven models, integrating multiple models for SOH estimation has received considerable attention. Ensemble learning (EL) typically leverages the strengths of multiple base models to achieve more robust and accurate outputs. However, the lack of a clear review of current research hinders the further development of ensemble methods in SOH estimation. Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews multi-model ensemble learning methods for battery SOH estimation. First, existing ensemble methods are systematically categorized into 6 classes based on their combination strategies. Different realizations and underlying connections are meticulously analyzed for each category of EL methods, highlighting distinctions, innovations, and typical applications. Subsequently, these ensemble methods are comprehensively compared in terms of base models, combination strategies, and publication trends. Evaluations across 6 dimensions underscore the outstanding performance of stacking-based ensemble methods. Following this, these ensemble methods are further inspected from the perspectives of weighted ensemble and diversity, aiming to inspire potential approaches for enhancing ensemble performance. Moreover, addressing challenges such as base model selection, measuring model robustness and uncertainty, and interpretability of ensemble models in practical applications is emphasized. Finally, future research prospects are outlined, specifically noting that deep learning ensemble is poised to advance ensemble methods for battery SOH estimation. The convergence of advanced machine learning with ensemble learning is anticipated to yield valuable avenues for research. Accelerated research in ensemble learning holds promising prospects for achieving more accurate and reliable battery SOH estimation under real-world conditions.

J	Mahdavifar, Hessam; Vardy, Alexander										Algebraic List-Decoding in Projective Space: Decoding With Multiplicities and Rank-Metric Codes								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY				65	2			1085	1100				10.1109/TIT.2018.2875527							Article	FEB 2019	2019	The problem of list decoding algebraic subspace codes and rank-metric codes is considered. We develop two separate methods, via two different approaches, for list decoding subspace codes and rank-metric codes. These methods provide, for certain code parameters, improved tradeoffs between rate and error-correction capability than that of the Koetter-Kschischang codes, in the domain of subspace codes, and than that of the Gabidulin codes, in the domain of rank-metric codes, and several other extensions thereof. In the first approach, we introduce the notion of root multiplicities for a certain sub-ring of the ring of linearized polynomials. In the list-decoding algorithm, multiple roots are enforced for the interpolation polynomial in order to achieve an improved error-correction radius for an extended family of Koetter-Kschischang subspace codes. The normalized error-correction radius for this approach istau(A) = 2(L+1)/(r+1) - 1 - L(L+1)(L+n)/r(r+1)R,where L is the maximum list size, n is the subspace code dimension, R is the rate of the code, and r is the multiplicity parameter. In the second approach, we construct a folded version of Koetter-Kschischang codes. A linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm is proposed for these codes that achieves the error-correction radiustau(B) = s(1 - sR),where s is the folding parameter. As opposed to the first approach, the size of output list in the second approach depends on the underlying field size and is at most q(m(s-1)), where q(m) is the size of the field that message symbols are chosen from. It is also shown that the output list size is 1, with high probability, in a probabilistic setting. We utilize the techniques of the second approach in the domain of rank-metric codes to construct folded Gabidulin codes to enable a linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm for such codes. Our algorithm makes it possible to recover the message provided that the normalized rank of error is at most 1 - R - epsilon, for any epsilon > 0. Notably, this achieves the Singleton bound on the error-correction radius of a rank-metric code.									3	0	0	0	0	0	5			0018-9448	1557-9654										Univ Michigan, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USAUniv Calif San Diego, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, La Jolla, CA 92093 USANanyang Technol Univ, Sch Phys & Math Sci, Singapore 639798, Singapore				2019-02-13	WOS:000456920000026

Compared to other medical continuum robots, the kinematic characteristics of the magnetic continuum robot are required to be improved, including operating dexterity. The opposite magnetic continuum robot (OMCR), which has oppositely-magnetized magnets on the robot, is capable of deforming in large and high-order curvatures and shows improved dexterity. However, unstable kinematic behaviors emerge owing to solution multiplicity and affect the actual operation. For example, snapping, which indicates the sudden jump from one state to another, induces danger for medical operations. In addition, the motion sequence of the external mobile magnet affects the final state of OMCR. Therefore, in this study, we first analyze the reason for these emerging behaviors by understanding the solution multiplicity of an OMCR. We then modified the OMCR kinematic model with instability analysis and additional constraints, to predict the critical point for snapping and avoid other unexpected behavior for path planning. Herein, our study aims to analyze the stability of the OMCR with relatively unstable configurations in their actuation space to ensure stable and dexterous motions for medical applications. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of this work is to analyze, predict, and avoid the unexpected behaviors of the medical magnetic catheter robots, and ensure stable and dexterous operation. Submillimeter magnetic catheter robots have received considerable attention in the past ten years owing to their small size and dexterous motion. They have great potential for minimally invasive surgical interventions that require the navigation of "tighter corners " inside the human body. However, there may exist multiple local solutions under an external field, especially when the robot deforms in high-order curvature for dexterous operation. This situation induces unexpected behaviors and danger for medical use, such as a sudden jump from one state to another. Herein, we analyze the solution evolution as the external field varies and predict the unexpected behaviors using a modified kinematic model with instability analysis. Preliminary experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the modified model, which can predict unexpected behaviors, and evaluate and enhance the stability during path planning. This method can be implemented for the dexterous and stable operation of magnetic catheter robots, which is significant for medical applications.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1545-5955	1558-3783										Chinese Acad Sci, Shenyang Inst Automat, State Key Lab Robot, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Robot & Intelligent Mfg, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R ChinaUniv Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Inst Robot & Intelligent Mfg, Shenyang 110016, Peoples R ChinaChiba Inst Technol, Dept Adv Robot, Chiba 2750016, Japan				2023-01-10	WOS:000903378400001

The model considered is a realistic description of wastewater treatment processes. A step-wise procedure is followed to reveal the mechanisms affecting the occurrence of steady states in terms of the process input variables. It is clearly demonstrated how taking into account inhibition effects by simply including additional inhibition terms to the kinetic expressions, a common practice, influences the model's long term behaviour. The overall steady state behaviour of the model has been summarized in easy-to-interpret operating diagrams, depicting the occurrence of steady states in terms of the reactor dilution rate and the influent substrate concentration, with well-defined boundaries between distinct operating regions. This knowledge is crucial for modelers as steady state multiplicity - in the sense that more than one steady state can be reached depending on the initial conditions - may remain undetected during simulation. The obtained results may also serve for experimental design and for model validation based on experimental findings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The conditions of its existence on the basis of the stoichiometric analysis of stage schemes of mono-route catalytic reactions are reported too. The program is composed on the basis of the algorithm which realizes MSS criterion. The necessary and sufficient criterion conditions are the existence of two different steady states in reaction simplex Sigma(i)x(i) = const. They are composed for each SS.The program in Maple-V for IBM computers works well. It permits to construct a system of stoichiometric inequalities (which realizes these necessary and sufficient conditions) and to establish its solvability for a concrete catalytic reaction. The program shows whether it is impossible or possible to describe MSS with the help of any investigated scheme. It determines SS coordinates and finds the values of stage rate constants. The program was used for computer research of different mechanisms of carbon monoxide oxidation on platinum metals. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It is known that, for large n, the blocks of a random set partition are typically of size W = W(n), with We(W) = n. We show that, over subsequences {n(k)}(k >= 1) of the sequence of the natural numbers, Mnk, appropriately normalized, converges weakly, as k ->infinity, to max{Z1,Z2-u}, where Z(1) and Z(2) are independent copies of a standard normal random variable. The subsequences {n(k)}(k >= 1), where the weak convergence is observed, and the quantity u depend on the fractional part f(n) of the function W(n). In particular, we establish that limk ->infinity 1/(2 pi)1/4min{fnk,1-fnk}nk/log7/4nk=u is an element of[0,infinity)?{infinity}. The behavior of the largest multiplicity M-n is in a striking contrast to the similar statistic of integer partitions of n. A heuristic explanation of this phenomenon is also given.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1042-9832	1098-2418										Amer Univ Bulgaria, Dept Math & Sci, Blagoevgrad 2700, BulgariaBulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Math & Informat, Akad Georgi Bonchev Bl 8, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria				2019-10-18	WOS:000489149200001

They are an adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a neural networks (NNs) system. The P-P-based ANFIS and NNs models calculate the multiplicity distribution of charged particles at different high energies. Simulation results of training charged particles using the ANFIS and NNs as tested with training data points showed perfect fitting to the experimental data. Prediction capabilities of the ANFIS and NNs checked with data points not used in training also proved to perform well. The results amply demonstrate the feasibility of these techniques in extracting the collision features and prove their effectiveness. It is found that the ANFIS shows better performance and trained more quickly than the NNs system.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0883-9514	1087-6545										Mansoura Univ, Dept Math, Fac Sci, New Damietta, EgyptAin Shams Univ, Fac Educ, Cairo, Egypt				2013-05-15	WOS:000317294700003

However, estimating key parameters such as allele frequencies, multiplicity of infection (MOI), and within-host relatedness from genetic data is challenging, particularly in the presence of multiple related coinfecting strains. Existing methods often rely on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and do not account for within-host relatedness. Results: We present Multiplicity Of Infection and allele frequency REcovery (MOIRE), a Bayesian approach to estimate allele frequencies, MOI, and within-host relatedness from genetic data subject to experimental error. MOIRE accommodates both polyallelic and SNP data, making it applicable to diverse genotyping panels. We also introduce a novel metric, the effective MOI (eMOI), which integrates MOI and within-host relatedness, providing a robust and interpretable measure of genetic diversity. Extensive simulations and real-world data from a malaria study in Namibia demonstrate the superior performance of MOIRE over naive estimation methods, accurately estimating MOI up to seven with moderate-sized panels of diverse loci (e.g. microhaplotypes). MOIRE also revealed substantial heterogeneity in population mean MOI and mean relatedness across health districts in Namibia, suggesting detectable differences in transmission dynamics. Notably, eMOI emerges as a portable metric of within-host diversity, facilitating meaningful comparisons across settings when allele frequencies or genotyping panels differ. Compared to existing software, MOIRE enables more comprehensive insights into within-host diversity and population structure.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			1367-4803	1367-4811										Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Berkeley, CA 94704 USAUniv Calif San Francisco, EPPIctr Program, Div HIV ID & Global Med, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA				2024-11-11	WOS:001346038100001	39423091

A deep reinforcement learning framework employing a multi -policy proximal policy optimization algorithm (MPPPO) is developed to solve MOMFJSP. The MOMFJSP is treated as a Markov decision process, allowing an intelligent agent to make sequential decisions based on the current production status. This framework involves multiple policy networks with different objective weight vectors. Using MPPPO, these networks are optimized simultaneously to obtain a set of highquality Pareto-optimal policies. Moreover, a fluid model is introduced to extract state features and devise composite dispatching rules as discrete actions. A multi -policy co -evolution mechanism (MPCEM) is proposed to facilitate collaborative evolution among policy networks, supported by a reward mechanism that considers the objective weights. A training algorithm based on MPPPO is designed for learning across multiple policy networks. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are confirmed through comparisons with composite dispatching rules and other scheduling methods.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2210-6502	2210-6510										Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Sch Mech Sci & Engn, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou, Peoples R ChinaWenzhou Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wenzhou, Peoples R ChinaGuangzhou Univ, Guangzhou Higher Educ Mega Ctr, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, 230 Wai Huan Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China				2024-05-19	WOS:001220825100001

Recently, machine learning-based therapeutic agents have gained the attention of researchers due to their high and reliable prediction results. However, the unsatisfactory performance of the existing predictors is due to their high execution cost and minimum predictive results. Therefore, the development of a reliable prediction is highly indispensable for scientists to effectively predict NPs. In this study, we presented an automatic and computationally effective model for identifying of NPs. The evolutionary information is formulated using a bigram position-specific scoring matrix (Bi-PSSM) and K-spaced bigram (KSB). Moreover, for noise reduction, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized to form Bi-PSSM_DWT and KSB_DWT based high discriminative vectors. In addition, one-hot encoding is also employed to collect sequential features from peptide samples. Finally, a multi-perspective feature set of sequential and embedded evolutionary information is formed. The optimum features are chosen from the extracted features via Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) by evaluating the contribution of the extracted features. The optimal features are trained via six classification models i.e., XGB, ETC, SVM, ADA, FKNN, and LGBM. The predicted labels of these learners are then provided to a genetic algorithm to form an ensemble classification approach. Hence, our model achieved a higher predictive accuracy of 94.47% and 92.55% using training sequences and independent sequences, respectively. Which is similar to 3% highest predictive accuracy than present methods. It is suggested that our presented tool will be beneficial and may execute a substantial role in drug development and research academia.

An important reference from energy security and sustainable development in other countries has been used to analyze the resistance and motivation of NEV's marketing in China. To achieve simultaneous growth of the global sale and market share of NEV and alleviate the energy shortage, the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) framework is applied in this study to analyze the influence factors and the resistance and motivation of marketing of NEV. MLP is a comprehensive analytical framework used for the research on technological transformation of the automotive industry. It can simultaneously focus on the impact of the main factors, namely, landscapes, regimes, and niches, on the marketing of NEV in China. The results show that regimes form a certain "blocking" for the marketing of NEV, and the "blocking" greatly suppresses the growth of the market share. Landscapes and niches have a considerable effect on the promotion of the NEV market and breakthrough of the traditional industry's "blocking". To further promote the marketing of NEV and alleviate the energy shortage, application policies should be made with notice of regional disequilibrium to improve the market competitiveness of NEV and ensure synchronous and sustainable growth of sales and market share.

Health information systems are envisioned to provide such data in a coherent manner, but different rationalities of those engaged in the collection and use of data, often lead to fragmentation. In this article we present a socio-technical analysis of the multiple flows of information construction for disease surveillance. Our study is based on fieldwork done in Burkina Faso in West Africa during 2015-2017. The case concerns meningitis control in Burkina Faso focusing on two flows in its meningitis surveillance and response system: (1) data flow from health worker's initial record on the first contact with the patient to the national level statistics compilation office, (2) substance and related data flows from the sample extracted by the health worker to the laboratories and their reporting of the test results. Drawing from the field of sociology of knowledge and technology, we base our analytical framework on four key concepts: circulating reference, multiplicities, rationalities, and temporalities. While circulating reference and multiplicities concern the "how" of information construction, rationalities and temporalities focus the attention on the "why", reflecting the positions of different actors. Our findings show that viewed over time, fragmentation also gives rise to coherence in the information system. Providing "good" data follows a "temporality of rationality", where data which are considered useful are highly affected by when they are needed, by whom, and for what purpose. Taken together, this framework provides for the development of sociologically grounded research on the how and why of information construction, which is also critical for improving the practice of disease surveillance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0197-2243	1087-6537										Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, POB 1080, N-0372 Oslo, Norway				2021-12-12	WOS:000727165700001

We use canonical firing sequences with nice properties for gcf-PNs to show that the RecLFS, (zero-) reachability, covering, and boundedness problems of gcf-PNs are in PSPACE. By simulating PSPACE-Turing machines by gss-PNs, a subclass of gcf-PNs where additionally all transitions have at most one outgoing arc, we ultimately obtain PSPACE-completess for these problems in case of gss-PNs or gcf-PNs. Additionally, we prove PSPACE-completeness for the liveness problem of gcf-PNs. Last, we show PSPACE-hardness as well as a doubly exponential space upper bound for the containment and equivalence problems of gss-PNs or gcf-PNs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-2968	1875-8681										Tech Univ Munich, Inst Informat, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany				2016-03-31	WOS:000371720800008

In this paper, we consider the service level for service time and delivery quantity separately. A novel mixed integer non-linear programming model is proposed to design the multi-period distribution network from a fourth-party logistics (4PL) perspective. The customer satisfaction based on prospect theory is maximised while considering the investment budget and the service level. A scenario-based linear reformulation is proposed to find the optimal solution when the problem scale is small. For a large-scale problem, we propose an individual-driven Q-learning based memetic particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the impact of service modes, different customer behaviour, and customer satisfaction evaluation periods on distribution network is investigated. We find that the length of evaluation periods leads to differences in customer satisfaction due to different perceptions of 'small loss' and 'big gain' by boundedly rational customers.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0020-7543	1366-588X										Northeastern Univ, Coll Informat Sci & Engn, Shenyang 110819, Liaoning, Peoples R ChinaLiaoning Petrochem Univ, Coll Informat & Control Engn, Fushun, Peoples R ChinaNorth Carolina State Univ, Edward P Fitts Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Raleigh, NC USA				2022-11-24	WOS:000881869200001

A high multiplicity PCR will outperform other technologies because of its lower cost, reaction time and sample consumption. To conduct a multiplex PCR with higher than 100 plex multiplicity, primers need to be carefully designed to avoid the formation of secondary structures and nonspecific amplification between primers, templates and products. Thus, a user-friendly, highly automated and highly user-defined web-based multiplex PCR primer design software is needed to minimize the work of primer design and experimental verification.Results: Ultiplex was developed as a free online multiplex primer design tool with a user-friendly web-based interface (http://ultiplex.igenebook.cn). To evaluate the performance of Ultiplex, 294 out of 295 (99.7%) target primers were successfully designed. A total of 275 targets produced qualified primers after primer filtration, and 271 of those targets were successfully clustered into one compatible PCR group and could be covered by 108 primers. The designed primer group stably detected the rs28934573(C > T) mutation at lower than a 0.25% mutation rate in a series of samples with different ratios of HCT-15 and HaCaT cell line DNA.Conclusion: Ultiplex is a web-based multiplex PCR primer tool that has several functions, including batch design and compatibility checking for the exclusion of mutual secondary structures and mutual false alignments across the whole genome. It offers flexible arguments for users to define their own references, primer Tm values, product lengths, plex numbers and tag oligos. With its user-friendly reports and web-based interface, Ultiplex will provide assistance for biological applications and research involving genomic variants.									9	0	0	0	5	0	12			1471-2164											Southern Med Univ, Zhujiang Hosp, Gen Surg Ctr, 253 Ind Blvd, Guangzhou 510280, Guangdong, Peoples R ChinaFoshan Fosun Chancheng Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Foshan 528010, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Igenebook Biotechnol Co Ltd, Med Dept, Floor 3,Bldg 1,Gaonong Biol Pk,888 Gaoxin Ave, Wuhan 430014, Hubei, Peoples R ChinaZhuhai City Peoples Hosp, Zhuhai Intervent Med Ctr, Zhuhai 519000, Peoples R ChinaCent South Univ Forestry & Technol, Coll Landscape Architecture, Changsha 410004, Peoples R China	Foshan Fosun Chancheng HospWuhan Igenebook Biotechnol Co LtdZhuhai City Peoples Hosp			2021-11-28	WOS:000720456400003	34794394

This model singularity is contrasted with the multimodel approach applied by existing object-oriented system analysis methods. These methods usually employ at least three distinct models for specifying various system aspects-mainly structure, function, and behavior. Object Modeling Technique (OMT), the main ancestor of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), extended with Timed Statecharts, represents a family of such multimodel object-oriented methods. Two major open questions related to model multiplicity vs. model singularity have been 1) whether or not a single model, rather than a combination of several models, enables the synthesis of a better system specification and 2) which of the two alternative approaches yields a specification that is easier to comprehend. In this study, we address these questions through a double-blind controlled experiment. To obtain conclusive results, real-time systems, which exhibit a more complex dynamic behavior than nonreal-time systems were selected as the focus of the experiment. We establish empirically that a single model methodology-OPM-is more effective than a multimodel one-OMT-in terms of synthesis. We pinpoint specific issues in which significant differences between the two methodologies were found. The specification comprehension results show that there were significant differences between the two methods in specific issues.					1st World Congress on Formal Methods in the Development of Computing Systems (FM 99)1st World Congress on Formal Methods in the Development of Computing Systems (FM 99)	SEP 20-24, 1999SEP 20-24, 1999	AMAST; Aerospatiale Airbus; Alcatel Space; CCIT; CEPIS; CNES; CNRS; Cap Gemimi; Carnegie Mellon Univ; Conseil Reg Midi Pyrenees; DGA; EATCS; ESA; ETAPS; European Union; FACS; FME; France Telecom; IFIP; INRIA; IPSJ; IRIT; JSSST; LAAS; Mairie Toulouse; Matra Marconi Space; ONERA; Tech Univ Delft; Tech Univ Denmark; Tech Univ Graz; Translimina; Univ Oxford; Univ ReadingAMAST; Aerospatiale Airbus; Alcatel Space; CCIT; CEPIS; CNES; CNRS; Cap Gemimi; Carnegie Mellon Univ; Conseil Reg Midi Pyrenees; DGA; EATCS; ESA; ETAPS; European Union; FACS; FME; France Telecom; IFIP; INRIA; IPSJ; IRIT; JSSST; LAAS; Mairie Toulouse; Matra Marconi Space; ONERA; Tech Univ Delft; Tech Univ Denmark; Tech Univ Graz; Translimina; Univ Oxford; Univ Reading	TOULOUSE, FRANCETOULOUSE, FRANCE	68	0	0	0	5	0	71			0098-5589											Stanford Univ, Sect Med Informat, Stanford, CA 94305 USAMIT, Sch Engn, Engn Syst Div, Cambridge, MA USA				2000-08-01	WOS:000089282300007

The benefit of such an approach is in the increased number of available observables. A pure neutron assay results in three observables for third-order multiples, while a combined neutron/gamma-ray assay results in nine observables for the same order of multiples. The idea is to use the additional observables to achieve greater accuracy when determining unknown parameters of the sample such as the fissile mass. The measurement system is based on liquid scintillation detectors (EJ-309s) which feed detected pulses to a digital data-acquisition system. The excellent pulse shape discrimination capabilities of the EJ-309s allow for accurate differentiation between gamma-ray pulses and neutron pulses. The PSD is vital to correctly identify the different multiples up to the third order: n, gamma, nn, n gamma, gamma gamma, nnn, nn gamma, n gamma gamma and gamma gamma gamma. Previous investigation of the measurement system showed that good counting statistics can be achieved within minutes for spontaneous-fission sources such as Cf-252.

Towards finding robust algorithmic recourse (or counterfactual explanations), existing literature often assumes that the original model m and the new model M are bounded in the parameter space, i.e., ||Params(M)-Params(m) || < Delta. However, models can often change significantly in the parameter space with little to no change in their predictions or accuracy on the given dataset. In this work, we introduce a mathematical abstraction termed naturally-occurring model change, which allows for arbitrary changes in the parameter space such that the change in predictions on points that lie on the data manifold is limited. Next, we propose a measure - that we call Stability - to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals to potential model changes for differentiable models, e.g., neural networks. Our main contribution is to show that counterfactuals with sufficiently high value of Stability as defined by our measure will remain valid after potential "naturally-occurring" model changes with high probability (leveraging concentration bounds for Lipschitz function of independent Gaussians). Since our quantification depends on the local Lipschitz constant around a data point which is not always available, we also examine estimators of our proposed measure and derive a fundamental lower bound on the sample size required to have a precise estimate. We explore methods of using stability measures to generate robust counterfactuals that are close, realistic, and remain valid after potential model changes. This work also has interesting connections with model multiplicity, also known as the Rashomon effect.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2641-8770										Univ Maryland Coll Pk, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Pk, MD 20742 USAJP Morgan Res, London E14 5JP, England	JP Morgan Res			2025-02-13	WOS:001395977600026

It identifies relaxations of fetch & increment, queues, sets and stacks that can be non-blocking or wait-free implemented using only Read/Write operations, without Read-After-Write synchronization patterns. Set-linearizability, a generalization of linearizability designed to specify concurrent behaviors, is used to formally express these relaxations and precisely identify the subset of executions which preserve the original sequential behavior. The specifications allow for an item to be returned more than once by different operations, but only in case of concurrency; we call such a relaxation multiplicity. Hence, these definitions give rise to new notions and new objects where concurrency explicitly appears in the specification of the objects. As far as we know, this work is the first to provide relaxations of objects with consensus number two which can be implemented using only Read/Write registers.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0178-2770	1432-0452										Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Matemat, Mexico City, DF, MexicoUniv Rennes, IRISA, CNRS, INRIA, Rennes, FrancePolytech Univ, Dept Comp, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Polytech Univ			2023-01-04	WOS:000894973000001

In fact, various events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have highlighted the weakness of global and local supply chains. Further, people are giving increasing importance to concepts such as social well-being, human rights, environmental protection. The maximisation of shareholder value is no longer the only goal for companies. The main purpose of this paper is to answer the following question: is there a strategy to address agri-food supply chains disruptions while revitalising local economies and improving - at the same time - a number of sustainability-related aspects? To this aim, a simulation model is designed, then tested and validated through a supermarket supply chain case study. The results show that disruptions can be exploited to revitalise small local suppliers and simultaneously increase several sustainability indicators from a multi-capital perspective. Several managerial insights are also provided.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1747-7778	1747-7786										Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, 45C Rende, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy				2024-04-24	WOS:001204571900001

Instead of engaging in current debates concerning the anticipated benefits and challenges of cellular agriculture, it is more useful to identify potential pathways leading to food system transitions. Our study aims to compare Finnish and German political stakeholders' (n = 25) perceptions con-cerning cultured meat and to analyse its potential transition pathways utilising the multi-level perspective (MLP). Data were collected via semi-structured theme interviews in early 2020. Results show that the participants acknowledge that landscape-level pressures, such as climate change or finite resources, are challenging current food systems. The food regime's position is perceived as somewhat uncertain. The current practices of livestock agriculture, strong food traditions and multiple interest groups' aspirations are anticipated to both hinder and advance a transition to cellular agriculture. On the niche innovation level, cultured meat was perceived as a promising yet technocratic solution. Cultured meat may be an option for continued meat consumption without feelings of guilt but with preconditions such as guaranteed safety, affordable prices and an authentic meat taste similar or better compared with conventionally produced meat. Our article concludes with three potential transition pathways for cellular agriculture. The "technocratic stagnation" pathway is characterised by perceived threats and stakeholder unwillingness to accept cultured meat. The "promising circumstances" pathway is emphasised by positive societal conditions for cultured meat development and stakeholders' incremental adaptation to it as an additional food product on the market. The "rapid advancement" pathway is characterised by technological breakthroughs and high acceptance of cultured meat, which could lead to radical changes in the current food system.									18	0	0	0	5	0	18			0048-7333	1873-7625										Univ Helsinki, Dept Agr Sci, Latokartanonkaari 7, Helsinki 00014, FinlandUniv Helsinki, Rural Inst, Lonnrotinkatu 7, Mikkeli 50100, FinlandUniv Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, Yliopistonkatu 3, Helsinki 00100, FinlandNat Resources Inst Finland, Latokartanonkaari 9, Helsinki 00790, FinlandUniv Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Latokartanonkaari 5,Room C222, Helsinki 00014, Finland				2023-08-28	WOS:001050314900001

When multiple viruses infect a single cell, progeny form by reassorted mixtures of genomic segments. Hybrid incompatibilities arise when a progeny virus has incompatible segments from different parental viruses. Hybrid incompatibility has been observed in influenza and in the multiparticle plant virus Dianthovirus. Hybrid incompatibility provides an opportunity to study rates of viral evolution, divergence and speciation, and the extent of epistatic interactions among, components of the viral genome. This paper presents mathematical and computer simulation models to study hybrid incompatibility between diverging strains. The models identify multiplicity of infection as a key factor. When many viral particles infect each host cell, the effective ploidy of the genetic system is high. High ploidy dilutes the contribution of each locus to the phenotype, weakening the selective intensity on each locus. Weaker selection on variant alleles allows the population to maintain greater genetic diversity and to be more easily perturbed by stochastic fluctuations. Greater diversity and stochastic fluctuations explore more widely the space of epistatic interactions, causing more frequent shifts among favoured combinations of alleles. Variable ploidy of viral genetics differs from standard Mendelian genetics.									31	0	0	0	22	0	32			0018-067X											Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Irvine, CA 92697 USA				2001-11-01	WOS:000173197700002	11869342

Public participation in collaborative governance (CG) of public crisis events is increasingly recognized as an important direction for the reform of the current and future emergency management system. Previous studies of CG have mainly focused on the macro level and ignored to address micro-level discussions of the behavioral strategy evolution of stakeholders. From a fresh value perception perspective, this study constructs an evolutionary game model to clarify the evolution mechanism of multi-level emergency CG. First, the value perception model is built based on Prospect Theory and Mental Accounting to optimize the traditional game matrix. Second, the evolutionary stability is analyzed to solve the system evolution law. Finally, numerical simulation is conducted in the case of Heilongjiang province, a main region of food and energy supply in China. Results showed that (1) the CG game system has a complex evolutionary path; (2) the behavior of game players is affected by perceived incomes and perceived costs; (3) compared with the reference value and the risk aversion coefficient of income accounts, game players are more sensitive to that of cost accounts; (4) enhancing the perceived value of public psychological satisfaction and government reputation is helpful for the long-term construction of CG. Overall, this study aims to highlight the potential utility of value perception in promoting effective implementations of CG and to provide new insights for the development of CG in China and other countries.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0272-4332	1539-6924										Harbin Engn Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R ChinaUniv Pittsburgh, Joseph M Katz Grad Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA USAChongqing Univ, Sch Management Sci & Real Estate, Chongqing, Peoples R China				2023-07-30	WOS:001029414500001	37455611

The novel business model can improve the energy utilization efficiency and promote the cross-border business integration. In some earlier studies, mainly focused on conceptual analysis of application scenarios and operation modes of MSI. However, quantitative analysis that measure MSI popularize remain under development. This article highlights the recent advance achievements in MSI of digital power grid regarding transformation of Chinese eight economic zones. From the perspective of spatial heterogeneity, the gravity model provides a framework for describing the spatial diffusion of MSI mode relative to eight economic zones (EEZ) in China. In addition, compared to conventional gravity model, this study improved four aspects of the basic spatial gravity model - diffusion capacity, absorptive capacity, the gravitation coefficient, and economic distance. It is found that the spatial diffusion of MSI is subjected to eight economic zones interaction while the spatial heterogeneity is inevitable. Thus, the resulting represents a radial decline, with the three coastal economic zones as the center, gradually decreasing to the inland and western regions, especially for those coastal economic regions with large diffusion impacts. Meanwhile, we also discuss the advantages, impacts, and limitations of MSI spatial diffusion as valuable references for future development direction of MSI mode. Ultimately, some of future development recommendations for MSI emerging field is put forward.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2577-8196										Shanghai Univ Elect Power, Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200090, Peoples R China				2022-02-14	WOS:000751681400001

A course where students use design thinking for analyzing real problems and proposing a solution, was evaluated. The study involved 910 novice university students from different disciplines who worked in teams throughout the semester. Data were collected at three times during the semester, i.e. at the beginning (t0), in the middle (t1) and at the end (t2), after solving a short case study. Each time the problem solving and creativity skill of each student was rated by three different actors, i.e. the students themselves (self-evaluation), one peer and one teacher (facilitator). The objective of this study is to investigate whether the problem solving skills and creativity skills improved along the course, as rated by the three actors. A repeated measures ANOVA was used for the data analysis of this within-subjects design. Results show a significant improvement on students' problem solving and creativity skills, according to the three raters. Effect sizes were also calculated; in all cases the effect sizes from t0 to t1 were larger than t1 to t2. The multi-actor perspective of this study, the adoption of reliable and valid measures and the large sample size provide robust evidence that supports the implementation of design thinking in higher education curriculum for promoting key skills such as problem solving and creativity, demanded by labor markets. Finally, a discussion that puts forward an agenda for future research is presented.									49	0	0	0	1	0	51			0957-7572	1573-1804										Univ Ghent, Ghent, BelgiumEscuela Super Politecn Litoral, I3lab Entrepreneurship & Innovat Ctr, Km 30-5 Via Perimetral, Guayaquil, EcuadorUniv Ghent, Dept Accounting, Corp Finance & Taxat, Ghent, BelgiumEscuela Super Politecn Litoral, Ctr Informat Technol, Guayaquil, EcuadorUniv Ghent, Dept Educ Sci, Ghent, Belgium				2022-01-11	WOS:000739248600001

Traditional methods for panoramic observation and map generation suffer from issues such as limited parallax tolerance, poor stitching robustness, and low mapping accuracy. In this paper, these problems are addressed by a proposed online panoramic method based on multi-perspective image projection and camera pose rectification. The proposed method incorporates a modified inverse projection module that dynamically adapts to the ship's attitude, thereby stably restoring the sea-ice images into bird's-eye view (BEV) in real-time. In order to resolve the challenging sea-ice feature alignment under significant parallax, a planar feature registration method is proposed which robustly aligns the features between the projected images. Moreover, a camera pose rectification module is specifically designed for planar projection tasks, which virtually adjusts the camera's extrinsic parameters for obtaining more precise and high-quality panoramic sea-ice maps. Finally, online construction of global sea-ice field maps is achieved by fusing the local maps during navigation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other panoramic methods in terms of map accuracy and stitching quality. Additionally, the proposed method is more suitable for downstream tasks, including polar simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path planning.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1524-9050	1558-0016										Zhejiang Univ, Inst Marine Sensing & Networking, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R ChinaMarine Design & Res Inst China, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ, Ocean Acad, Hangzhou 310058, Peoples R ChinaPolar Res Inst China, Technol Innovat Ctr Polar, Shanghai 201209, Peoples R ChinaZhejiang Univ, Key Lab Ocean Observat Imaging Testbed, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2025-01-19	WOS:001395139300001

In this study, we utilized Multi-Camera Perspectives to analyze the forecast trajectory from both a real-world Outdoor Field and a simulated Virtual Field. Our comprehensive analysis of the results unveiled substantial distinctions in the X-axis error between the outdoor field and the virtual field. Delving deeper into the data, we conducted a meticulous decomposition of Xaxis and Y-axis errors, revealing a remarkable disparity in the X-axis error for the outdoor field when compared to all other data. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that the forecast accuracy in the outdoor field is susceptible to a myriad of disturbing factors, resulting in the pronounced X-axis error divergence. Specifically, the influence of the Magnus Effect was identified as a significant contributor to this phenomenon. Collaborative cross-disciplinary applications in sports. The implications of this study are expected to provide invaluable insights for researchers and practitioners working in the realm of sports analytics and virtual-reality applications, signifying pivotal achievements in innovative sports technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4174	1873-6793										Natl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Kaohsiung, TaiwanNatl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Kaohsiung, TaiwanNatl Kaohsiung Univ Sci & Technol, Phys Educ Off, Kaohsiung, Taiwan				2025-05-23	WOS:001490732700001

All but the minimal solutions are unstable as solutions of the time-dependent version of the above equations.The extension of these methods to spherically annular domains 0 < alpha < r < 1, with an inner boundary condition u'(alpha) = A(less-than-or-equal-to 0), shows strikingly different behaviour. First, the infinite multiplicity disappears and is approached asymptotically as alpha --> 0+. Second, the uniqueness of the solution for small lambda also disappears. This last fact has implications for the basis of stability of the minimal steady-state. The case A not-equal 0 is still under investigation. Collaborators in this work are P.

Due to limited data, identifying the true benefiting population is a challenging task. To tackle this difficulty, the credible subgroups approach provides a pair of bounding subgroups for the true benefiting subgroup, constructed so that one is contained by the benefiting subgroup while the other contains the benefiting subgroup with high probability. However, the method has so far only been developed for parametric linear models.Methods In this article, we develop the details required to follow the credible subgroups approach in more realistic settings by considering nonlinear and semiparametric regression models, supported for regulatory science by conditional power simulations. We also present an improved multiple testing approach using a step-down procedure. We evaluate our approach via simulations and apply it to data from four trials of Alzheimer's disease treatments carried out by AbbVie.Results Semiparametric modeling yields credible subgroups that are more robust to violations of linear treatment effect assumptions, and careful choice of the population of interest as well as the step-down multiple testing procedure result in a higher rate of detection of benefiting types of patients. The approach allows us to identify types of patients that benefit from treatment in the Alzheimer's disease trials.Conclusion Attempts to identify benefiting subgroups of patients in clinical trials are often met with skepticism due to a lack of multiplicity control and unrealistically restrictive assumptions. Our proposed approach merges two techniques, credible subgroups, and semiparametric regression, which avoids these problems and makes benefiting subgroup identification practical and reliable.									11	1	0	0	5	0	13			1740-7745	1740-7753										Ohio State Univ, Div Biostat, Coll Publ Hlth, 226 Cunz Hall,1841 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USAUniv Texas Austin, Dept Math, Austin, TX 78712 USAAbbVie, N Chicago, IL USASanofi, Bridgewater, NJ USAUniv Minnesota, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Biostat, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA				2018-02-16	WOS:000424201000012	29035083

The data were collected from small, medium and micro enterprises (SMME) from Western Cape/South Africa, an area marked by long-term water consumption restrictions. A qualitative approach was considered for variable tailoring to the SMMEs' peculiarities, followed by a quantitative study, employing a sample of 237 companies, for testing each competitive advantage dimension against the established green marketing tools and company descriptive variables using logistic regressions. Each competitiveness variable was explained by at least one green marketing tool. Donating money and/or allocating time for environmental purposes explained three dependent variables, while selling biodegradable/recycled/refurbished products had an inverse relationship with two of them. Business type and number of operational years had a significant impact on three dimensions. This study enriches the literature by using green competitive advantage dimensions and not a latent factor, analyzing the impact of company descriptive variables as explanatory variables and prompting green strategies for small and medium businesses. The model could be improved by tests in other geographic areas, including green distribution and price variables and other descriptive factors (turnover, responsible investment and internationalization).									24	0	0	1	0	0	25				2071-1050										Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management Sci, Dept Mkt, Keizersgracht & Tennant St, ZA-8000 Cape Town, South AfricaRomanian Amer Univ, Fac Management Mkt, Management Mkt Dept, 1B Expozitiei Blvd, Bucharest 012101, RomaniaBucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Int Business & Econ, Dept Int Business & Econ, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania	Romanian Amer Univ			2018-11-20	WOS:000448559400406

Our main goal is to exhibit the usefulness of quadratic programming approaches to solve these classes of high multiplicity scheduling problems, with the total weighted completion time as the minimization criterion. We develop polynomial algorithms for some models, and strongly polynomial algorithms for certain special cases. In particular, the model in which the weights are job independent, as well as the generally weighted model in which processing requirements are job independent, can be formulated as an integer convex separable quadratic cost Bow problem, and therefore solved in polynomial time. When we specialize further, strongly polynomial bounds are achievable. Specifically, for the weighted model with job-independent processing requirements if we restrict the weights to be machine independent (while still assuming different machine speeds), an O(mn + n log n) algorithm is developed. If it is also assumed that all the machines have the same speed, the complexity of the algorithm can be improved to O(m log m + n log n). These results can be extended to related unweighted models with variable processing requirements in which all the machines are available at time zero.									5	0	0	0	0	0	6			0178-4617											SUNY STONY BROOK,WA HARRIMAN SCH MANAGEMENT & POLICY,STONY BROOK,NY 11794TEL AVIV UNIV,SCH MATH SCI,IL-69978 TEL AVIV,ISRAEL				1997-02-01	WOS:A1997VX37600002		
J									Silvio Donizetti de Oliveira Gallo; Laisa Blancy de Oliveira Guarienti		Cartographies of educational variation and the multiplicities in the thought																												Awarded Grant	Aug 01 2014	2014	The project aims to map the variations in school thinking and encumbrances that makes this process possible, namely, investigate, through educational workshops, with an emphasis on the arts, learning problems highlighted mainly by teachers, psychologists, educational psychologists and psychiatrists dealing with such issues as open to inventive learning fields. Transforming the problem of learning acquisition, diagnosed as a psychopathological disorder, strategies for thinking about education. Considering the relevance with respect to current problems of school education, proposes to enhance these changes in ways of apprehending the principle undesirable by the school community, and overturn such thinking. Make an inverted set of the problem, where the problem considered illness and maladjustment becomes an interesting, desirable and potential problem for developing other forms of expression with students. Workshops invention will be performed, using artistic means connected to the body and the images, so that these problems are moving toward something that acquires meanings in the practice of apprentices life, proliferating different images of thought ( multiplicity) and not only the Orthodox images (accommodation, representation and recognition ) strongly institutionalized. Think these workshops as educational practices in connection with the arts, seeking to establish the possible creation of interesting problems to a collective of students and enhance thoughts regarded as unsuitable for the school institution as new ways of expressing a new think multiplier.

Projects, which can be partitioned into relatively few classes, are to be scheduled subject to resource and generalised precedence constraints. We show that there exists symmetry between projects of the same class and propose two approaches of symmetry breaking: (1) adding additional constraints to the model in the form of precedence constraints, (2) remodelling the problem to reduce the number of variables. To test the usefulness of the symmetry breaking approaches a computational study is completed considering two families of discrete-time based MIP models and a number of state-of-the-art CP-based scheduling approaches. The study shows that both symmetry breaking approaches allow all solving methods to find and prove more optimal solutions. The best CP approach is then used to find a number of new best solutions to relevant problems from the MPSPlib, a multi-project scheduling problem library, for both the total makespan and average project delay objective, whereas the best MIP approach is used to determine a number of tighter lower bounds.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0160-5682	1476-9360										Monash Univ, Sch Math Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, AustraliaUniv Melbourne, Sch Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia				2019-06-20	WOS:000470531800001		
J	Li, Weijie; Kang, Jinwen; Wang, Yong										Land Use Conflicts Identification and Multi-Scenario Simulation in Mountain Cities, Southwest China: A Coupled Structural and Functional Perspective								LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT				36	5			1492	1512				10.1002/ldr.5440					DEC 2024		Article	MAR 2025	2025	Land use conflicts (LUCs) arise during land use change, causing an uncoordinated spatial structure of the land and negatively affecting the synergistic development of multifunctionality, especially in mountain cities. Previous studies have focused on identifying and measuring land use structural conflicts (LUSC), with less attention paid to land use functional conflicts (LUFC), and a lack of simulation for future multi-scenarios. Thus, taking Chongqing as an example, based on the perspective of LUSC-LUFC coupling, this study constructed a comprehensive conflict index to identify and assess LUCs, then applied the PLUS model to predict LUCs under three development scenarios in 2030. This study found that (1) there was a significant positive spatial association between LUSC and LUFC, with high-high agglomeration types in areas of severe LUCs and low-low agglomeration types in areas of light LUCs. (2) During 2000-2020, the LUCs in Chongqing displayed a trend of upward and then downward from 2000 to 2020, with significant agglomeration in their spatial pattern. (3) Two typical areas of LUCs intensification were identified, namely the topographic transition zone located in the Daba and Wuling mountains and the urban-rural interface in the Chongqing metropolitan area. (4) In 2030, the LUCs in Chongqing manifest an overall mitigation in the ecological protection (EP) scenario, while displaying an intensification in the natural development (ND) and economic development (ED) scenarios. Based on the types of spatial interaction between LUSC and LUFC, land use optimization strategies were formulated. The findings will provide scientific references for sustainable land use management decisions in Chongqing and other mountainous cities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1085-3278	1099-145X										China West Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanchong, Peoples R ChinaChina West Normal Univ, Sichuan Prov Engn Lab Monitoring & Control Soil Er, Nanchong, Peoples R ChinaSouthwest Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Chongqing Key Lab Karst Environm, Chongqing, Peoples R China				2024-12-27	WOS:001378865100001

One of the primary reasons for gross overheating of catalyst pellet can be a transition from one steady state to another. The fundamental catalytic processes in the petrochemical-and chemical industries are characterized by a multistage set of the specific chemical transformations with a significant chemical transformations with a significant number of the reactants participating therein. One result is complications of the mathematical model of catalyst pellet, into with a large number of equations, beginning with heat and material balances, enter. This has led in many practical situations to extremely complicated procedures for analysis of steady-state multiplicity and to the impossibility of scientifically based selections of the mathematical model for a catalytic process, reflecting the results of industrial experimentation over a wide range of variation of the technological parameters. These difficulties can be successful overcome if the dimensionality of the model equations is sharply curtailed by the use of invariants of the physicochemical systems which are derived a priori.

Described as "Sarwa wranvishapaka", i.e. having a capability to heal all types of wounds, it is particularly recognized for its usage in splenomegaly. Towards exploring the comprehensive effects of T. purpurea against polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and three comorbid neuropsychiatric diseases (anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder), its constituent phytochemicals (PCs) were extensively reviewed and their network pharmacology evaluation was carried out in this study. The complex regulatory potential of its 76 PCs against PCOS is enquired by developing and analyzing high confidence tripartite networks of protein targets of each phytochemical at both pathway and disease association scales. We also developed a high-confidence human Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) sub-network specific to PCOS, explored its modular architecture, and probed 30 drug-like phytochemicals (DPCs) having multi-module regulatory potential. The phytochemicals showing good binding affinity towards their protein targets were also evaluated for similarity against currently available approved drugs present in DrugBank. Multi-targeting and synergistic capacities of 12 DPCs against 10 protein targets were identified and evaluated using molecular docking and interaction analyses. Eight DPCs as a potential source of PCOS and its comorbidity regulators are reported in T. purpurea. The results of network-pharmacology study highlight the therapeutic relevance of T. purpurea as PCOS-regulator and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in revealing action-mechanism of Ayurvedic herbs from holistic perspective.									16	0	0	0	7	0	16			0378-1119	1879-0038										Cent Univ Himachal Pradesh, Sch Life Sci, Ctr Computat Biol & Bioinformat, Dharamshala 176206, IndiaGovt India, Minist AYUSH, Dr DP Rastogi Cent Res Inst Homeopathy, Mol Biol Lab,Drug Standardizat Unit, Noida 201301, Uttar Pradesh, India	Govt India			2021-03-10	WOS:000618325700009	33383117

Our intent is to understand the current state of research in Industry 4.0 in different disciplines and deduce insights and opportunities for future research in operations management. In this paper, we provide a focused analysis to examine the state-of-the-art research in Industry 4.0. To learn about researchers' perspectives about Industry 4.0, we conducted a large-scale, cross-disciplinary and global survey on Industry 4.0 topics among researchers in industrial engineering, operations management, operations research, control and data science at the 9th IFAC MIM 2019 Conference in Berlin in August 2019. By using our survey findings and literature analysis, we build structural and conceptual frameworks to understand the current state of knowledge and to propose future research opportunities for operations management scholars.

J	Leathem, Thomas; Hillesheim, Christina; Coley, Aressa; McGregor, Shane										Student and teacher perspectives on a multi-disciplinary collaborative pedagogy in architecture and construction								HIGHER EDUCATION SKILLS AND WORK-BASED LEARNING				9	1			121	132				10.1108/HESWBL-03-2018-0026							Article	FEB 11 2019	2019	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a unique pedagogical approach intended to address a need of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) professions for graduates to work in cross-disciplinary collaborative teams. Addressing this industry need has been challenging for higher education programs in the past. The pedagogy evaluated in this study takes a unique approach to addressing the issue and the aim of the study is to capture the effectiveness of the approach. Design/Methodology/Approach This paper presents a qualitative research study evaluating perceptions of students and faculty participating in the cross-disciplinary course experience between architecture and construction. The study evaluated perceived vs received learning outcomes and perceived challenges of the cross-disciplinary course approach. Data were collected from open-ended interviews and observations of students and faculty participating in the course, as well as course artifacts. Findings Results of the study indicate alignment between perceived and received outcomes. Identified perceptions of challenges to the approach reflect many identified in previous studies. Areas for future study, and practice in collaborative education within the AEC disciplines are also suggested. Research Limitations/Implications This research used a qualitative approach to evaluate perspectives of six students and two teachers in a specific pedagogical approach at one university. Given the small sample size and delimitation of one-course approach, findings from this study are not generalizable to a broader population. In addition to providing valuable data for future quantitative studies on a larger population, the study also provides pedagogical options for other schools to consider implementing and studying. The findings support previous research suggestions that collaborative approaches done early and often for longer durations are needed to address collaborative learning challenges. Originality/Value The pedagogical approach evaluated in this study takes a unique approach to addressing a well-documented need in the AEC industry. Information included in this paper demonstrates an approach not yet documented in AEC higher education. Further, it provides a glimpse into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges that contribute a body of knowledge for others in the discipline to build from. The findings suggest a more in-depth approach may help cross the negative student impressions developed in shorter in-frequent approaches, and begin to develop student understanding of the value and necessity of multi-disciplinary collaboration.									9	0	0	0	0	0	11			2042-3896	2042-390X										Auburn Univ, McWhorter Sch Bldg Sci, Coll Architecture Design & Construct, Auburn, AL 36849 USAHiwassee Coll, Madisonville, TN USAMississippi State Univ, Coll Educ, Starkville, MS USA	Hiwassee Coll			2019-02-15	WOS:000457406600009

The MAP test, which minimizes the average probability of detection error, exploits the noisy (erroneous) information about the true packet that the destination receives (overhears) directly from the source nodes as a reference. We show that the average probability of detection error decreases exponentially as the number of source nodes increases, regardless of the reliability of the reference information. This indicates that the multiplicity of source nodes can be leveraged to construct a powerful integrity check mechanism for detecting false data at the destination. We also present a parallel MAP test that improves the detection accuracy when the number of source nodes is limited and overhearing channel disparities are high. Then, we present a packet recovery mechanism to recover false alarmed packets, i.e. unmodified packets that are mistakenly declared as modified, by the MAP test and thereby to improve the throughput.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1556-6013	1556-6021										Iowa State Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Ames, IA 50011 USA				2020-05-05	WOS:000527936100003

The continuation technique is based on the generalized inverse iteration with Rayleigh quotient. The using of the multigrid and the conjugate gradient for nonsymmetric systems methods in the continuation algorithm is tested. The choice of the preconditioner is also analysed for the conjugate gradient methods. The numerical performances of the different algorithms used are investigated and compared. The key parameter of the investigation is the reaction parameter. The effect of the other parameters on the bifurcation behaviour is briefly analyzed.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0098-1354															1995-03-01	WOS:A1995QG87700009		
J	Huang, An; Yang, Youlong										FMEA risk assessment method: Integration of multi-perspective weights and interval cloud model with TOPSIS approach								EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS				289						128377			10.1016/j.eswa.2025.128377							Article	SEP 15 2025	2025	Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) serves as a thorough risk evaluation technique aimed at enhancing the security and reliability of application systems. However, during the implementation of FMEA, several defects have been identified, such as the improper setting of the Risk Priority Number (RPN), the inability to differentiate the weights of various risk factors, and the neglect of ambiguity in expert evaluations. To address these defects, this study proposes an FMEA risk assessment method that integrates the TOPSIS approach with multi-perspective weights and interval cloud models. Initially, the SHEL model is used to identify potential failure modes, and a 7-level cloud model converts expert interval linguistic preference evaluations into interval clouds to handle fuzziness and randomness. Subsequently, the subjective weight of risk factors is determined using the possibility degree matrix, while the objective weight is derived from collected evaluation information. The comprehensive weight combines both subjective and objective weights. In addition, the first type of expert weight is determined based on the degree of hesitation. The second type of expert weight is calculated according to similarity measures. We systematically analyze the calculation formula for the overlapping area between two cloud models under various cases and quantify expert similarity using the ratio of the overlapping area to the total cloud area, thereby determining the second type of expert weight. The overall expert weight integrates both types. Risk priority is then determined using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. The proposed model improves the scientific determination of weights for risk factors and experts, enhances computational efficiency, and effectively discriminates failure modes. Finally, the model is applied to robot-assisted rehabilitation risk analysis, with sensitivity, comparative, and simulation analyses confirming its viability and practicality.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4174	1873-6793										Xidian Univ, Sch Math & Stat, 266 Xinglong Sect Xifeng Rd, Xian 710126, Shaanxi, Peoples R China				2025-06-20	WOS:001509141800001

Therefore, selecting the best site is a key influencer of the plant's ability to sustainably provide the expected benefits throughout its whole lifecycle. An important contribution could be provided by developing specific tools for improving decision accuracy while addressing the issue of sustainability through the decision-making process. In this view, this study aims to propose a decision-making model for selecting the best alternative from a number of predetermined PHES candidate sites, in a perspective of sustainable development. The approach is based on the identification of decision factors and criteria, and the use of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), rating scales and fuzzy logic-based scoring systems, and the ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) III. These methods are comprehensively selected and combined to deal with the heterogeneity of the information and the vagueness of human preference and, to operationalise the concept of strong sustainability. Its practicality and efficiency was successfully tested on a set of eleven PHES candidate sites in Western Cameroon. As result the five best alternatives to be considered in the framework of the country's sustainable power generation policy were suggested in descending order of priority: (1)-Enep, (2)-Mbatu-dam, (3)-Benakuma, (4)-Bamendjin, (5)-Mentchum.									82	2	0	0	3	0	84			1364-0321	1879-0690										Univ Yaounde I, Natl Adv Sch Engn, Yaounde, Cameroon				2019-07-24	WOS:000474208400062

This uncoordinated data dissemination may result in significant, yet unnecessary communication and processing overheads, ultimately reducing the utility of information networks. To alleviate the negative impacts of this information multiplicity phenomenon, we propose that a subset of nodes (selected at key positions in the network) carry out additional information filtering functionality. Thus, nodes are responsible for the removal (or significant reduction) of the redundant data items relayed through them. We refer to such nodes as filters. We formally define the FILTER PLACEMENT problem as a combinatorial optimization problem, and study its computational complexity for different types of graphs. We also present polynomial-time approximation algorithms and scalable heuristics for the problem. Our experimental results, which we obtained through extensive simulations on synthetic and real-world information flow networks, suggest that in many settings a relatively small number of filters are fairly effective in removing a large fraction of redundant information.									4	0	0	0	0	0	7			2150-8097											Boston Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA				2012-01-01	WOS:000219717600004

In this study, a VCA-MLC (Vertex Component Analysis-Maximum Likelihood Classification) algorithm is proposed from the perspective of multi-temporal satellite LAI image classification to monitor and quantify the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation dynamics in China since 2000. The algorithm extracts the vegetation endmembers from 46 multi-temporal images of MODIS LAI in 2011 without the aid of other a priori knowledge and uses the maximum likelihood classification method to select the categories that satisfy the requirements of the number of missing periods, absolute distance, and relative distance for the rest pixels to be classified, ultimately dividing the vegetation area of China into 10 vegetation zones called China Vegetation Functional Zones (CVFZ). CVFZ outperforms MCD12Q1 and CLCD land cover datasets in the overall differentiation of vegetation functions and can be used synergistically with other land cover datasets. In this study, CVFZ is used to cut the constant vegetation-type pixels of MCD12Q1 during 2001-2022. The results of the LAI mean time series decomposition of each subregion using the STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition based on Loess) method show that the rate of vegetation greening ranges from 9.02 x 10(-4) m(2)m(-2)yr(-1) in shrubland subregions to 2.34 x 10(-2) m(2)m(-2)yr(-1) in savanna subregions. In relative terms, the average greening speed of forests is moderate, and savannas tend to have the fastest average greening speed. The greening speed of grasslands and croplands in different zones varies widely. In contrast, the average greening speed of shrublands is the slowest. In addition, CVFZ detected grasslands with one or two phenological cycles, broadleaf croplands with one or two phenological cycles, and shrublands with no apparent or one phenological cycle.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2072-4292										Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Ctr GeoData & Anal, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R ChinaChina Univ Geosci, Sch Land Sci & Technol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R ChinaPeking Univ, Key Lab High Confidence Software Technol, Beijing 100871, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Inst Econ & Management, Sch Linkong Econ & Management, Beijing 100102, Peoples R China	Beijing Inst Econ & Management			2023-07-08	WOS:001018334100001

Our analysis is based on the application of Mellin transform techniques to ordinary generating functions, which yields an asymptotic expansion of the ordinary generating function L(z) of L(n) near its dominant singularity z = 1. The application of a simple transfer lemma eventually provides the required asymptotic expansion of L(n) as n --> infinity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0302-9743	1611-3349														1992-01-01	WOS:A1992KQ20300019

This study establishes a stakeholder-centered risk assessment framework to enhance decision-making of waterway engineering projects and promote the sustainable development of Inland Waterway Transport. We propose a three-layer approach: (1) identifying key stakeholders in the decision-making stage of waterway engineering projects through multi-dimensional criteria; (2) listing and classifying decision-making risks from the perspectives of managers, users, and other stakeholders; (3) applying the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to prioritize key risks and proposing a risk assessment model based on fuzzy reasoning theory to evaluate decision-making risks under uncertain conditions. This framework was applied to the Yangtze River Trunk Line Wuhan-Anqing Waterway Regulation Project. The results show that the risk ranking is managers, users, and other stakeholders, among which the risk of engineering freight demand is particularly prominent. This suggests that we need to pay attention to optimizing material transportation and operational organization, promote the development of large-scale ships, and realize the diversification of ship types and transportation organizations. This study combines fuzzy reasoning with stakeholder theory, providing a replicable tool for the Waterway Management Authority to address the complex sustainability challenges in global waterway development projects.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2071-1050										Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Logist Engn, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R ChinaChangjiang Waterway Inst Planning & Design, Wuhan 430040, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430063, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Business Univ, Sch Business Adm, Wuhan 430056, Peoples R China	Changjiang Waterway Inst Planning & Design			2025-06-29	WOS:001516352900001

These two problems are known to be modelled by a class of quadratic programs that are efficiently solvable in polynomial time. On the parallel setting, both problems are P-complete and hence cannot be efficiently solved in parallel unless P = NC. To deal with the parallel approximablity of these problems, we show first a parallel additive approximation procedure to a subclass of multi-valued quadratic programming, called smooth multi-valued QP, which is defined by imposing certain restrictions on the coefficients of the instance. We use this procedure to obtain parallel approximation to dense instances of the two problems by observing that dense instances of these problems are instances of smooth multi-valued QP. The dense instances of the problems considered here are defined similarly as for other combinatorial problems in the literature. For such instances we can find in parallel a near optimal schedule. The definition of smooth multi-valued QP as well as the procedure for approximating it in parallel are of interest independently of the application to the scheduling problems considered in this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0988-3754	1290-385X										Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept LSI, ES-08034 Barcelona, Spain				2008-04-01	WOS:000254189700003

A systematic literature review was conducted, analyzing 405 research papers published between 2000 and 2024, from which 69 relevant papers were selected to identify 48 key factors contributing to cost overrun. Using K-means clustering, these factors were grouped into three clusters based on their probability and impact, which were classified for their risk levels. To ensure robust analysis, a survey was conducted to gather expert opinions, resulting in 369 valid responses from owners, contractors/subcontractors, and management firms/consultants. The fuzzy group decision-making approach (FGDMA) was conducted to rank all 48 factors, offering a detailed assessment of their relative importance. Based on these rankings, the top 20 factors were identified for analysis to examine variations in stakeholder priorities, capturing differences in perspectives among multi-stakeholders. Sensitivity analysis and Tornado charts explored the critical variations among stakeholders, with management firms/consultants and owners prioritizing design-related risks, such as inconsistencies and delays in approvals, while contractors/subcontractors focused more on material waste. This novel integration presents a structured approach for analyzing, prioritizing, and mitigating cost overrun risks, offering a comprehensive framework that provides practical insights for stakeholders to improve cost and risk management strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2075-5309										Helwan Univ Mataria Branch, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Project Management & Sustainable Construct Program, POB 11718, Cairo, EgyptHelwan Univ Mataria Branch, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, PON 11718, Cairo, EgyptAustralian Univ Kuwait, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Safat 13015, KuwaitInt Univ Kuwait IUK, Adjunct Fac Civil & Architectural Engn, Ardiya 92400, Kuwait	Helwan Univ Mataria BranchHelwan Univ Mataria BranchAustralian Univ KuwaitInt Univ Kuwait IUK			2025-02-18	WOS:001419250500001

Such approaches use meta-heuristic search guided by search operators (model mutators and sometimes breeders) implemented as model transformations. The design of these operators can substantially impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the meta-heuristic search. Currently, designing search operators is left to the person specifying the optimisation problem. However, developing consistent and efficient search-operator rules requires not only domain expertise but also in-depth knowledge about optimisation, which makes the use of model-based meta-heuristic search challenging and expensive. In this paper, we propose a generalised approach to automatically generate atomic multiplicity-preserving search operators for a given optimisation problem. This reduces the effort required to specify an optimisation problem and shields optimisation users from the complexity of implementing efficient meta-heuristic search mutation operators. We evaluate our approach with a set of case studies and show that the automatically generated rules are comparable to, and in some cases better than, manually created rules at guiding evolutionary search towards near-optimal solutions.									13	0	0	0	0	0	14			1619-1366	1619-1374										Kings Coll London, Dept Informat, 30 Aldwych, London WC2B 4BG, EnglandPhilipps Univ Marburg, Dept Informat, Hans Meerwein Str 6, D-35043 Marburg, Germany				2022-02-10	WOS:000685372300001

These codes have found many applications beyond the traditional scope of coding theory. In this paper, we introduce improved bounds on the list size for list decoding these codes, achieved through a more streamlined proof method. Additionally, we refine an existing randomized algorithm to output the codewords on the list, which enhances its success probability and reduces its running time. Lastly, we establish list-size bounds for a fixed decoding parameter. Notably, our results demonstrate that FRS codes asymptotically attain the generalized Singleton bound for a list of size 2 over a relatively small alphabet, marking the first explicit instance of a code with this property.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9448	1557-9654										Tel Aviv Univ, Dept Elect Engn, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel				2025-01-30	WOS:001400994700018

Taking Suzhou City in Anhui Province as the research case, based on thematic mapper /enhanced thematic mapper+ (TM/ETM+) remote sensing data from 1998 to 2018, through the transfer matrix model and modified conversion of land use and its effects at small region extent (CLUE-S) model, the simulation of the land use landscape pattern evolution was studied from a multi-scenario perspective. The results showed that in the past 20 years, landscape patterns have undergone spatial-temporal conversion, which was mainly manifested as the evolution from a cultivated land landscape and other agricultural land to construction land, and there was some transformation between other landscape types, but the transformation degree was not significant. The spatial autocorrelation factor was introduced to correct the CLUE-S model, and the Kappa index reached 0.83, indicating that the modified CLUE-S model had a good simulation accuracy. (I) In the cultivated land protection scenario, limiting the conversion of basic farmland use, and by 2028, the proportion of cultivated land increased by 5.23%, distributed in eastern Suzhou City; (II) in the economic development scenario, by 2028, the construction land area increased by 14.58%, and was distributed in the surrounding regions of the built-up areas; and (III) in the ecological protection scenario, by 2028, wood land, water, and other ecological protection land area increased, and were distributed in the central and eastern part of Suzhou City. Research can provide useful decision-making support for land use optimization and remediation.									16	3	0	0	5	0	19				1660-4601										Yangzhou Univ, New Rural Dev Res Inst, Yangzhou 225009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China				2021-02-19	WOS:000615151200001	33494445

However, the conformational rearrangement, supramolecular organization and dynamics upon interaction with DNA have been overlooked, which prevents the rational design of such detection tools. To elucidate the binding of a cationic polythiophene (CPT) to DNA with atomistic resolution, we performed molecular simulations of their supramolecular assembly. Comparison of replicated simulations show a multiplicity of CPT binding geometries that contribute to the wrapping of CPT around DNA. The different binding geometries are stabilized by both electrostatic interactions between CPT lateral cations and DNA phosphodiesters and van der Waals interactions between the CPT backbone and the DNA grooves. Simulated circular dichroism (CD) spectra show that the induced CD signal stems from a conserved geometrical feature across the replicated simulations, i. e. the presence of segments of syn configurations between thiophene units along the CPT chain. At the macromolecular scale, we inspected the different shapes related to the CPT binding modes around the DNA through symmetry metrics. Altogether, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, model Hamiltonian calculations of the CD spectra, and symmetry indices provide insights into the origin of induced chirality from the atomic to the macromolecular scale. Our multidisciplinary approach points out the hierarchical aspect of CPT chiral organization induced by DNA.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1439-4235	1439-7641										Univ Mons UMONS, Lab Chem Novel Mat, Ctr Innovat & Res Mat & Polymers CIRMAP, 20 Pl Parc, B-7000 Mons, BelgiumOpen Univ Israel, Dept Nat Sci, Raanana, IsraelUniv Montpellier, ENSCM, CNRS, ICGM, Montpellier, France				2020-11-18	WOS:000590060000001	32910539

Taking the advantage of the time scale separation, these processes are decomposed into fast subsystem and slow subsystem according to the dynamics. In the proposed method, an approach that combines the approximate solutions obtained from both the fast and slow subsystems to form a composite solution of the original system is proposed. Also, based on the fast and slow subsystems, a distributed state estimation scheme is proposed to handle the implicit time-scale multiplicity. In the proposed design, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed for the fast subsystem and a moving horizon estimator (MHE) is designed for the slow subsystem. In the design, the slow subsystem is only required to send information to the fast subsystem one-directionally. The fast subsystem estimator does not send out any information. The estimators use different sampling times, that is, fast sampling of the fast state variables is considered in the fast EKF and slow sampling of the slow state variables is considered in the slow MHE. Extensive simulations based on a chemical process are performed to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed subsystem decomposition and composite estimation architecture.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0001-1541	1547-5905										Univ Alberta, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Edmonton, AB T6G 1H9, Canada				2022-03-13	WOS:000763864600001

The device mainly consists of 32 self-developed EJ-301 liquid scintillation detectors arranged in a spherically symmetrical configuration. These detectors are read out by a 32-channel electronics system equipped with an online field-programmable gate array (FPGA) neutron-gamma discrimination function. In addition, the device integrates a self-designed graphical user interface (GUI), enabling interactive operations such as control and monitoring of the readout electronics and high-voltage power supply. The one-parameter calibration and three-parameter assay methods are used for data analysis to estimate the mass of various 252Cf neutron sources. The results show that the device can accurately measure the mass of 252Cf neutron sources (with an equivalent 240Pueff mass range of 7.84-1929.15 g). Additionally, the three-parameter assay method is used to estimate the 240Pueff mass of four PuO2 samples, and the relative deviations (RDs) between estimated and true 240Pueff mass and relative uncertainties are all less than +/- 4.5% and 2.75%, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9499	1558-1578										North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Nucl Sci & Engn, Beijing 102206, Peoples R ChinaState Nucl Secur Technol Ctr, Beijing 102401, Peoples R ChinaShenzhen Univ, Coll Phys & Optoelect Engn, Inst Adv Study Nucl Energy & Safety, Shenzhen Key Lab Nucl & Radiat Safety, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China	State Nucl Secur Technol Ctr			2025-05-04	WOS:001473598700014

Using the variational structure of the above boundary value problem and critical point theory, it is shown that the different locations of the pair (eta,zeta) and lambda is an element of R lead to different existence results for the above boundary value problem. More precisely, if the pair (eta,zeta) is on the left side of the first eigenvalue line, then the above boundary value problem has only the trivial solution for lambda is an element of (-infinity, 0) and has infinitely many solutions for lambda is an element of (0, infinity); if (eta,zeta) is on the right side of the first eigenvalue line and lambda is an element of (-infinity, 0), then the above boundary value problem has two nontrivial solutions or has at least n(*) (n(*) is an element of N) distinct pairs of solutions, which depends on the fact that the pair (eta,zeta) is located in the second or fourth (first) quadrant.

Big data is representative of geographic data from numerous sources. It has the advantages of large amounts of data, high timeliness, and abundant information, which may compensate for the inadequacy of traditional planning and design, which is overly subjective. Big data can be used to obtain large-scale human movement data to study hospital characteristics from a supply-demand balance perspective. Here, 182 comprehensive hospitals in three districts of Shenzhen were picked as an example, and multi-source data were introduced as a quantitative assessment tool to analyze them. First, the mobile public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) was researched and developed independently and used to collect volunteered geographic information (VGI) data, which was adopted to quantify hospital service supply. Second, the population's demand for hospitals was characterized by the quantified point of interest (POI) data. Finally, the location entropy method was utilized to quantify the levels of supply and demand for comprehensive hospital services from a supply-demand balance perspective, which was used to guide the classification of the comprehensive hospitals. The result shows that: (1) the service scopes and the service pressure are different for the same type of comprehensive hospitals classified by the traditional method; (2) the spatial distribution of patients is related to land function; (3) the overlap area between the part with a high service pressure level in the comprehensive hospital and the part with high medical demand of the patient is prone to service blindness. This study paves a new way to optimize the spatial allocation of medical institutions or other types of public facilities, rationalize resource allocation, and alleviate urban transportation congestion.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2071-1050										Hosei Univ, Grad Sch Engn & Design, Tokyo 1028160, JapanJinan Univ, Shenzhen Tourism Coll, Shenzhen 518000, Peoples R ChinaSuzhou Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Suzhou 215011, Peoples R China				2023-03-23	WOS:000941419800001

The theoretical basis of children's sub-health is to start from the whole. The common clinical sub-health conditions cannot be explained by modern detection methods, and it can be screened and analyzed with the help of big data in medical informatization. The combination of "Internet + " and the health care model is an innovation in the construction of medical informatization. It can provide many considerate services to the masses in time and alleviate the anxiety of illness. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out the efficacy evaluation of children's sub-health from the perspective of medical information. Therefore, this paper completes the following work with the help of AI neural network: (1) This paper proposes an improved AlexNet network evaluation method based on attention mechanism. In this study, attention mechanism is added to the original AlexNet model to weight each channel of the feature layer. At the same time, we improve the large convolution kernel of the previous layers of the original AlexNet network and use batch normalization instead of the local response normalization (LRN) layer in the original model. (2) This paper proposes an evaluation method based on improved residual network, which improves the original residual block of the residual model and widens the residual block. The residual block can effectively reduce the amount of network parameters and improve the efficiency of network training. (3) This paper proposes an evaluation method of multi-scale feature fusion (MSFF). The features extracted from the improved AlexNet and residual network are fused and then evaluated. At this time, the training time is greatly shortened, and the accuracy is higher than that of single model.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0941-0643	1433-3058										Henan Univ Chinese Med, Henan Prov Hosp TCM, Dept Pediat, Zhengzhou 450000, Henan, Peoples R China				2023-11-06	WOS:001089027100001

Such structures appear as seemingly rigid filaments, rotating without changing their shape. The most interesting (heretofore unseen) feature of such a class of physical attractors is their variety. Indeed, distinct shapes are found for a fixed value of the Rayleigh number depending on parameters accounting for particle inertia and viscous drag. The fascinating "sea" of existing potential paths, their multiplicity and tortuosity are explained according to the granularity of the loci in the physical space where conditions for phase locking between the traveling thermofluid-dynamic disturbance and the "turnover time" of particles in the basic toroidal flow are satisfied. It is shown, in particular, how the observed wealth of geometric objects and related topological features can be linked to a general overarching attractor representing an intrinsic (particle-independent) property of the base velocity field.

In Indonesia, however, its deployment remains limited due to fragmented stakeholder views and lack of integrated policy support. This study explores multi-stakeholder perspectives, including government, academia, business, finance, media, and civil society, on the role and feasibility of CCS/CCUS in achieving the country's net zero emissions (NZE) target. Using a mixed-method approach, we conducted structured surveys (n = 39) and in-depth interviews (n = 34). Findings reveal broad support for CCS/CCUS but highlight ongoing concerns about economic viability, regulatory uncertainty, and environmental risks. Stakeholders emphasize the need for stronger government incentives and cross-border financing mechanisms. The study underscores the importance of inclusive policymaking, enhanced fiscal support, and integration of CCS/CCUS into Indonesia's carbon economic value framework to ensure a more participatory and sustainable climate policy pathway.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2071-1050										Univ Indonesia, Sch Environm Sci, Jakarta 10430, Indonesia				2025-07-18	WOS:001527548400001

Since computer models struggle to address these issues, the paper advances socio-technical scenarios as a novel methodological tool. Contributing to recent dialogue approaches, we develop an eight-step methodological procedure that produces socio-technical scenarios through various interactions between the multi-level perspective and computer models. As a specific contribution, we propose 'transition bottlenecks' as a methodological aid to mediate dialogue between qualitative MLP-based analysis of contemporary dynamics and quantitative, model-generated future pathways. The transition bottlenecks also guide the articulation of socio-technical storylines that suggest how the social acceptance and political feasibility of particular low-carbon innovations can be improved through social interactions and endogenous changes in discourses, preferences, support coalitions and policies. Drawing on results from the 3-year PATHWAYS project, we demonstrate these contributions for the UK electricity system, developing two low-carbon transition pathways to 2050 commensurate with the 2 degrees C target, one based on technological substitution (enacted by incumbent actors), and one based on broader system transformation (enacted by new entrants).									58	1	0	0	8	0	59			0040-1625	1873-5509										Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Denmark Rd Bldg, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, EnglandFraunhofer Inst Syst & Innovat Res, Karlsruhe, Germany				2020-03-02	WOS:000509818900062

Based on the analysis of digital refocusing principle of terahertz light field imaging, the original data of the terahertz light field is collected by using a terahertz focal plane array camera, and the depth of digital refocusing is located by determining the minimum generalization error. Finally, the reconstructed image is enhanced by using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The terahertz image of the object with clear contour and interference suppression is obtained. The experimental results show that the combination of terahertz light field technology and synthetic aperture technology can effectively reduce the influence of occlusion, and it is proved that EMD method has the ability to improve the quality of terahertz image.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0253-2239											Minist Educ, Key Lab Terahertz Optoelect, Beijing 100048, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Key Lab Terahertz Spect & Imaging, Beijing 100048, Peoples R ChinaBeijing Adv Innovat Ctr Imaging Theory & Technol, Beijing 100048, Peoples R ChinaCapital Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China	Minist EducBeijing Key Lab Terahertz Spect & ImagingBeijing Adv Innovat Ctr Imaging Theory & Technol			2022-07-30	WOS:000828330000009

Genetic (molecular) measures like multiplicity of infection (MOI) have several advantages compared with traditional measures, e.g., R-0. Here, we investigate the properties of a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate MOI and pathogen-lineage frequencies. By verifying regulatory conditions, we prove asymptotical unbiasedness, consistency and efficiency of the estimator. Finite sample properties concerning bias and variance are evaluated over a comprehensive parameter range by a systematic simulation study. Moreover, the estimator's sensitivity to model violations is studied. The estimator performs well for realistic sample sizes and parameter ranges. In particular, the lineage-frequency estimates are almost unbiased independently of sample size. The MOI estimate's bias vanishes with increasing sample size, but might be substantial if sample size is too small. The estimator's variance matrix agrees well with the Cramer-Rao lower bound, even for small sample size. The numerical and analytical results of this study can be used for study design. This is exemplified by a malaria data set from Venezuela. It is shown how the results can be used to determine the necessary sample size to achieve certain performance goals. An implementation of the likelihood method and a simulation algorithm for study design, implemented as an R script, is available as Si File alongside a documentation(S2 File) and example data (S3 File).									11	0	0	0	6	0	12			1932-6203											Univ Appl Sci Mittweida, Dept CB, Mittweida, Germany	Univ Appl Sci Mittweida			2018-12-28	WOS:000429505000006	29630605

Glycerol as a source of substrate appears to have great potential, due to its large supply because of the increase in biodiesel production. This paper will discuss the multiplicity of steady states for the production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol by Clostridium butyricum, employing a model that takes into account inhibition by fermentation products. The theoretical study of bifurcation enabled us to make a qualitative adjustment to the various experimental steady states, using the theoretical steady states obtained from the AUTO2007 program. The theoretical model parameters were varied to fit qualitatively the values of the experimental steady states. In addition, this work is a qualitative study, using experimental steady states that can be used as an initial study for more advanced work on optimizing the production of 1,3-propanediol.									10	0	0	0	6	0	11			1615-7591	1615-7605										Fed Univ Pernambuco UFPE, Dept Chem Engn, BR-50740520 Recife, PE, Brazil				2015-03-04	WOS:000349024000003	25090981

The vast majority of research in this area is focused on algorithmic techniques. Most recently, Blake and Lin proposed a computational technique to count the number of cycles of length g in a bi-regular bipartite graph, where g is the girth of the graph. The information required for the computation is the node degree and the multiplicity of the nodes on both sides of the partition, as well as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph (graph spectrum). In this paper, the result of Blake and Lin is extended to compute the number of cycles of length g + 2, ... , 2g - 2, for bi-regular bipartite graphs, as well as the number of 4-cycles and 6-cycles in irregular and half-regular bipartite graphs, with g >= 4 and g >= 6, respectively.									13	1	0	0	0	0	14			0018-9448	1557-9654										Carleton Univ, Dept Syst & Comp Engn, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada				2019-06-04	WOS:000468433400028

QUALITY & SAFETY IN HEALTH CARE				14	5			358	363				10.1136/qshc.2005.014159							Article	OCT 2005	2005	Objectives: To identify the terms and definitions used by organisations involved in medication safety and to examine differences in functional meaning using a novel scenario assignment method.Methods: Medication safety related terms and definitions were sought from websites of organisations associated with medication safety. The functional meanings of terms and definitions were analysed and compared using a scenario assignment method where each definition found was assessed against four scenarios with a central theme.Main outcome measures: Medication safety related terms and definitions currently in use, similarities and differences in their functional meanings, and practical implications of the use of these terms and definitions.Results: Thirty three of 160 websites searched were found to have one or more definitions for medication safety related terms. Twenty five different terms with 119 definitions were found. The most frequently defined groups of terms were ''adverse event'' (8 different definitions), ''error'' (n = 9), ''near miss'' (n = 12), ''adverse reaction'' (n = 8), and ''incident'' ( n = 4). Substantial diversity of functional meanings of definitions was demonstrated using the scenario-assignment method. Of the five groups of frequently defined terms, definitions within the ''adverse event'', ''near miss'', and ''incident'' groups resulted in three functional meanings each, while two functional meanings resulted for ''error'' and ''adverse reaction''.Conclusion: The multiplicity of terms, definitions and, most importantly, functional meanings demonstrates the urgent need for agreement on standardisation of nomenclature describing medication related occurrences. This is an essential prerequisite to enable meaningful analysis of incidence data and development of medication safety improvement strategies.									58	0	0	0	26	2	73			1475-3898											Monash Univ, Victorian Coll Pharm, Ctr Medicat Safety, Dept Pharm Practice, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia				2005-10-01	WOS:000232208800011	16195570

They consistently need to implement new technologies and deliver the right product at the right time in response to customer demand. This necessitates a high level of adaptability and efficiency in their manufacturing processes. Flexible job- shops offer a more efficient alternative to traditional manufacturing practices by accommodating these needs. Additionally, in actual manufacturing plants, multiple jobs are typically required for each part type. To address this complexity, this article investigates the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with multiplicity (MFJSP). We propose a deep self-learning method based on deep reinforcement learning and fluid master-apprentice evolutionary algorithm (DSLFMAE) to minimize makespan for the MFJSP. The proposed DSLFMAE is the integration of a fluid master-apprentice evolutionary (FMAE) algorithm and a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The FMAE algorithm serves as the core optimization method, employing the PPO algorithm to dynamically adjust the control parameters of the FMAE algorithm during the optimization process. Twelve state features are extracted to capture the evolutionary states of the FMAE algorithm accurately, and a long short-term memory Q-network (LSTM-Q) is designed to encode these continuous states. Subsequently, to adjust multiple interrelated control parameters of the FMAE algorithm simultaneously, a multivariate Gaussian distribution-based PPO algorithm is developed to train the LSTM-Q network. Numerical outcomes show the efficacy and superiority of the DSLFMAE in addressing the flexible job-shop scheduling problem with multiplicity (MFJSP) across different scales.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2210-6502	2210-6510										Guangzhou Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R ChinaHuazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaWenzhou Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wenzhou 325060, Peoples R ChinaLiaocheng Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Liaocheng 252000, Shandong, Peoples R China				2025-03-26	WOS:001448057600001

Crash data sets are highly skewed where fatalities and severe injuries are often less represented compared to other events. The severity prediction performance of the existing models is poor due to the highly imbalanced samples of different severity levels within a given dataset. This paper proposes a machine learning based analysis framework from a multi-class classification perspective for accurate recognition of the driver injury patterns. The proposed framework includes preprocessing, classification, evaluation and application of a given dataset. This framework is verified based on the three years single-vehicle ROR (run-off-road) crash records collected in Washington State from 2011 to 2013. At first, thirteen most important safety-related variables are recognized through random forests. Then, the four driver's injury severity levels viz., fatal/serious injury, evident injury, possible injury, and no injury are predicted by integrating the decomposed binary neural network models to achieve better performance. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to interpret variables' impacts on the decomposed injury severity levels. The study shows that lack of restraint, female drivers, truck usage, driver impairment, driver distraction, vehicle overturn (rollover), dawn/dusk, and overtaking are the leading factors contributing to the driver fatalities or severe injuries in a single-vehicle ROR crash. Most of the findings are consistent with the previous studies. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework which can be further applied for pattern recognition in traffic safety research.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0001-4575	1879-2057										Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Informat & Elect, Beijing 100081, Peoples R ChinaUniv Washington, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA				2018-10-16	WOS:000446144800016	30138770

Vital to these activities are complex nucleoprotein structures, however, how these form remains unclear. Integration host factor (IHF) is an Escherichia coli NAP that creates very sharp bends in DNA at sequences relevant to several functions including transcription and recombination, and is also responsible for general DNA compaction when bound non-specifically. We show that IHF-DNA structural multimodality is more elaborate than previously thought, and provide insights into how this drives mechanical switching towards strongly bent DNA. Using single-molecule atomic force microscopy and atomic molecular dynamics simulations we find three binding modes in roughly equal proportions: 'associated' (73 degrees of DNA bend), 'half-wrapped' (107 degrees) and 'fully-wrapped' (147 degrees), only the latter occurring with sequence specificity. We show IHF bridges two DNA double helices through non-specific recognition that gives IHF a stoichiometry greater than one and enables DNA mesh assembly. We observe that IHF-DNA structural multiplicity is driven through non-specific electrostatic interactions that we anticipate to be a general NAP feature for physical organization of chromosomes.									25	1	0	0	16	0	28			0305-1048	1362-4962										Univ York, Dept Phys, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, EnglandUniv York, Dept Biol, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England				2021-08-05	WOS:000697383500024	34352078

We present a perspective on how models based on the equilibrium criteria of fugacity and chemical activity can contribute to all three evaluations, thus providing a consistent and seamless assessment process. Persistence and its closely related, but fundamentally different property, chemical residence time can be determined from degradation half-lives (typically obtained from monitoring data) and multi-media mass balance models describing chemical fate and transport in real or evaluative environments. Bioaccumulation is driven by equilibrium partitioning processes that can be estimated from fugacity models treating uptake by respiration and diet in single organisms and in food webs, most commonly for aquatic systems for which confirmatory monitoring data can be obtained. Biomagnification is readily evaluated both experimentally and as a fugacity (or activity) increase from prey to predator. Toxicokinetic evaluations of chemical uptake and disposition in a variety of organisms, including humans, can be obtained using fugacity- and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models. Toxicodynamic processes of chemical interactions with organisms leading to adverse toxic outcomes are less obviously amenable to fugacity assessment with the notable exception of baseline toxicity (narcosis), the most common mode of action of commercial chemicals. It is shown that a range of fugacities can be defined and correlated for specific species thus enabling direct comparison of fugacities estimated or monitored in the environment with fugacities resulting in baseline toxicity. Finally, it is shown that fugacity and activity can serve as multi-media metrics of chemical contamination in ecosystems, thus enabling identification of specific regions and species at greatest risk in a pictorial format that is readily understandable to scientific and regulatory communities and to the general public.									8	0	0	0	7	0	9			2050-7887	2050-7895										Trent Univ, Dept Chem, CEMC, Chem Properties Res Grp, Peterborough, ON K9L OG2, CanadaQueens Univ, Dept Chem, 99 Univ Ave, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, CanadaARC Arnot Res & Consulting, Toronto, ON, CanadaUniv Toronto, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada	ARC Arnot Res & Consulting			2020-05-01	WOS:000526894100005	31993610

XBRL-adopted financial reporting has been increasingly becoming prevalent in the field of financial accounting information. The related research of XBRL adoption is a hot topic, mainly focusing on technical specifications, classification standards, and application effects of XBRL adoption. However, currently few studies have paid attention to the effect of XBRL-adopted financial reporting on corporate governance, particularly on executive compensation management. Moreover, most of the conclusions from these studies are inconsistent. This paper aims to comprehensively explore the effect of XBRL-adopted financial reporting on the sensitivity of executive compensation performance creatively from a multi-dimensional perspective. This perspective includes three dimensions of the XBRL-adopted time period, firm property, and performance, plus the 3-D crossover. The findings show that a law exists for describing the evolution of the effect of XBRL adoption over time, which indicates that the effect of XBRL adoption during an early period is greater than that during a later period. In the firm property dimension, the sensitivity of executive compensation performance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is higher than that of non-SOEs after XBRL adoption, and the sensitivity changing rate of SOEs is also greater than that of non-SOEs. In the firm performance dimension, the sensitivity of the executive compensation performance of well-governed firms is higher than that of poorly governed firms after XBRL adoption, but the sensitivity changing rate of well-governed firms is smaller than that of poorly governed firms. Furthermore, in the cross-dimension of time period and firm property, the effect of XBRL adoption on the sensitivity of executive compensation performance in non-SOEs shows a similar law to that in the time-period dimension. However, no obvious law is shown in SOEs. In the cross-dimension of time period and firm performance, the effect of XBRL adoption on the sensitivity of executive compensation performance in well-governed firms also shows a similar law to that in the time-period dimension. However, no obvious law is shown in poorly governed firms. In the cross-dimension of firm property and firm performance, the sensitivity of executive compensation performance is closely correlated to firm performance, and correspondingly, poorly governed non-SOEs show a low sensitivity, which is even significantly lower than those in both the overall poorly governed firms and the overall non-SOEs. The findings can help firms to identify their special properties, performances, and XBRL-adopted time periods to make appropriate decisions to improve the performance of executive compensation management after XBRL adoption.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536											Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Informat Management & Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China				2018-12-28	WOS:000452368900001

This tool takes as input one or several datasets obtained in radiation experiments and returns as output the list of events that were identified, without any limitation on the type of device (SRAMs, DRAMs, PSRAMs, FPGAs, and so on) or manufacturing technology (planar, FinFET, and so on). The classification method used consists in analyzing statistical anomalies found in the input dataset(s) that would not be found in a theoretical scenario where only single-bit upsets (SBUs) can occur.

The major challenge in the integration of design and control is the presence of disturbances and process uncertainty, particularly in the nonlinear process with multiple steady states. A fuzzy model is used as a surrogate model to reduce computational loading in a large operating scope in this work. Based on fuzzy model rules, a robust PI controller design using linear matrix inequalities is developed to guarantee the disturbance rejection performance, stability, and robustness. Finally, through an illustrative process with multiplicity behaviors, the features of the proposed method are demonstrated. Comparisons between the proposed method and the conventional sequential approach are made. The resulting design shows that the proposed method under the designed process with uncertainty would gain more profits than the past design approaches.

Recently advanced LFCs mainly utilize micro-lens arrays (MLAs) as a key component to acquire rich 3D information, including depth, encoded color, reflectivity, refraction, occlusion, and transparency. The wide field-of-view (FOV) capability of LFCs, which is expected to be of great benefit for extended applications, is obstructed by the fundamental limitations of LFCs. Here, we present a practical strategy for the wide FOV-LFC by adjusting the spacing factor. Multiplicity (M) is the inverse magnification of the MLA located between the image plane and the sensor, which was introduced as the overlap ratio between the micro-images. M was adopted as a design parameter in several factors of the LFC, and a commercial lens with adjustable FOV was used as the main lens for practicality. The light-field (LF) information was evaluated by considering the pixel resolution and overlapping area in narrow and wide FOV. The M was optimized for narrow and wide FOV, respectively, by the trade-off relationship between pixel resolution and geometric resolution. Customized wide FOV-LFCs with different M were compared by spatial resolution test and depth information test, and the wide FOV-LFC with optimized M provides LF images with high accuracy.									6	2	0	0	0	0	8				1424-8220										Gwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 123 Cheomdangwagi Ro, Gwangju 61005, South KoreaGwangju Inst Sci & Technol, Artificial Intelligence & Grad Sch, 123 Cheomdangwagi Ro, Gwangju 61005, South Korea				2022-05-22	WOS:000794379200001	35591145

The distinction between these arrhythmias is an important consideration in addressing the problem of reducing false-positives in detection mechanisms for implantable devices. Dual chamber analysis that examines atrial and ventricular event ratios has been proposed as a solution to this problem, but would still fail in distinguishing paroxysmal VT requiring treatment from a fast but otherwise benign ventricular response during atrial fibrillation or flutter. In this study, two methods for discriminating these tachyarrhythmias were evaluated. Method 1 examined ventricular rate and rate regularity as a method for VT detection. Method 2 combined rate and regularity as well as an additional multiplicity criterion for recognition of atrial flutter with a fast ventricular response. In 20 patients, Method 1 had 100% sensitivity of VT detection and 80% specificity for detection of atrial fibrillation or flutter. Method 2 had 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. These results suggest that use of these algorithms in future implantable devices would result in a decrease in false-positive device therapies.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0147-8389											UNIV MICHIGAN,SCH ENGN,DEPT ELECT ENGN & COMP SCI,ANN ARBOR,MIST JOSEPH MERCY HOSP,MICHIGAN HEART & VASC INST,ANN ARBOR,MI 48104ST JOSEPH MERCY HOSP,CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOL LAB,ANN ARBOR,MI 48104				1994-09-01	WOS:A1994PF00800009	7991421

These efforts require monitoring disease transmission at a level that differentiates between pathogen variants at the genetic/molecular level. In fact, the advantages of genetic (molecular) measures like multiplicity of infection (MOI) over traditional metrics, e.g., R-0, are being increasingly recognized. MOI refers to the presence of multiple pathogen variants within an infection due to multiple infective contacts. Maximum-likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to derive MOI and pathogen-lineage frequencies from molecular data. However, these methods are biased.Methods and findingsBased on a single molecular marker, we derive a bias-corrected ML estimator for MOI and pathogen-lineage frequencies. We further improve these estimators by heuristical adjustments that compensate shortcomings in the derivation of the bias correction, which implicitly assumes that data lies in the interior of the observational space. The finite sample properties of the different variants of the bias-corrected estimators are investigated by a systematic simulation study. In particular, we investigate the performance of the estimator in terms of bias, variance, and robustness against model violations. The corrections successfully remove bias except for extreme parameters that likely yield uninformative data, which cannot sustain accurate parameter estimation. Heuristic adjustments further improve the bias correction, particularly for small sample sizes. The bias corrections also reduce the estimators' variances, which coincide with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. The estimators are reasonably robust against model violations.ConclusionsApplying bias corrections can substantially improve the quality of MOI estimates, particularly in areas of low as well as areas of high transmission-in both cases estimates tend to be biased. The bias-corrected estimators are (almost) unbiased and their variance coincides with the Cramer-Rao lower bound, suggesting that no further improvements are possible unless additional information is provided. Additional information can be obtained by combining data from several molecular markers, or by including information that allows stratifying the data into heterogeneous groups.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1932-6203											Univ Appl Sci Mittweida, Dept Appl Comp & Biosci, Mittweida, Germany	Univ Appl Sci Mittweida			2022-03-18	WOS:000760118200025	34965279

Flexible job shops offer organizations the agility and cost-efficiency that traditional manufacturing processes lack. However, the dynamics of modern manufacturing, including machine breakdown and new order arrivals, introduce unpredictability and complexity. This study investigates the multiplicity dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (MDFJSP) with new order arrivals. To address this problem, we incorporate the fluid model to propose a fluid randomized adaptive search (FRAS) algorithm, comprising a construction phase and a local search phase. Firstly, in the construction phase, a fluid construction heuristic with an online fluid dynamic tracking policy generates high-quality initial solutions. Secondly, in the local search phase, we employ an improved tabu search procedure to enhance search efficiency in the solution space, incorporating symmetry considerations. The results of the numerical experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the FRAS algorithm in solving the MDFJSP when compared to other algorithms. Specifically, the proposed algorithm demonstrates a superior quality of solution relative to existing algorithms, with an average improvement of 29.90%; and exhibits an acceleration in solution speed, with an average increase of 1.95%.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2073-8994										Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Mech Sci & Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R ChinaWenzhou Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wenzhou 325060, Peoples R China				2024-07-04	WOS:001256682800001

To perform pattern recognition and track fitting in online trigger system, the artificial Retina algorithm has been introduced in the field. Retina can be implemented in the state-of-the-art field-programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. Our developments use Retina in an iterative way to identify tracks in a barrel-shaped tracker embedded in a high magnetic field and with high track multiplicity. As a benchmark, we simulate LHC t-tbar events from 14-TeV proton-proton collisions, with a pile-up of 200 interactions. The produced particles are propagated using GEANT-4 in a 4-T magnetic field from the interaction point through a six-layer barrel tracker made of silicon modules. With this sample, the performance of the hardware design [FPGA resource usage and latency] is evaluated. Both track reconstruction efficiency and purity of the Retina track finding are over 90%. To improve further the resolution on the track parameters, we are investigating the addition of a Kalman filter process on the FPGA, after the Retina step. First results obtained with an emulator of the Kalman filter are also discussed in this article.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9499	1558-1578										Ctr China Normal Univ CCNU, Coll Phys Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R ChinaUniv Libre Bruxelles ULB, Interuniv Inst High Energies IIHE, B-1050 Brussels, BelgiumNaval Univ Engn, Coll Elect Engn, Wuhan 430033, Peoples R China	Ctr China Normal Univ CCNU			2021-09-02	WOS:000687247300058

Unfortunately, traditional Internet technologies have been designed around the restrictive assumption of a single working path between a source and a destination. The lack of native multipath support constrains network performance even as the underlying network is richly connected and has redundant multiple paths. Computer networks can exploit the power of multiplicity, through which a diverse collection of paths is resource pooled as a single resource, to unlock the inherent redundancy of the Internet. This opens up a new vista of opportunities, promising increased throughput (through concurrent usage of multiple paths) and increased reliability and fault tolerance (through the use of multiple paths in backup/redundant arrangements). There are many emerging trends in networking that signify that the Internet's future will be multipath, including the use of multipath technology in data center computing; the ready availability of multiple heterogeneous radio interfaces in wireless (such as Wi-Fi and cellular) in wireless devices; ubiquity of mobile devices that are multihomed with heterogeneous access networks; and the development and standardization of multipath transport protocols such as multipath TCP. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the literature on network-layer multipath solutions. We will present a detailed investigation of two important design issues, namely, the control plane problem of how to compute and select the routes and the data plane problem of how to split the flow on the computed paths. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic articulation of the main design issues in network-layer multipath routing along with a broad-ranging survey of the vast literature on network-layer multipathing. We also highlight open issues and identify directions for future work.									64	0	0	0	1	0	64				1553-877X										Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Dept Elect Engn, Islamabad 44000, PakistanSunway Univ, Fac Sci & Technol, Subang Jaya 47500, Selangor, MalaysiaUniv Cambridge, Comp Lab, Cambridge CB3 0FD, EnglandUniv Cambridge, Comp Lab, Networked Syst, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England				2015-12-25	WOS:000365233100015

The effects on decision quality of two important communication system factors, cue multiplicity and feedback immediacy, are examined in light of three important mediating constructs: social perceptions, message clarity, and ability to evaluate others. A laboratory experiment examining two tasks and employing face-to-face, electronic meeting, electronic conferencing, and electronic mail communication systems is used to assess the model's validity. Results provide consistent support for the research model as well as media richness theory.Richer media facilitate social perceptions (total socio-emotional communication and positive socio-emotional climate) and perceived ability to evaluate others' deception and expertise. Leaner media (electronic mail and electronic conferencing) facilitate communication clarity when participants have less task-relevant knowledge. The impacts of these mediating constructs on decision quality were found to depend on the levels of participant expertise and deception. In general, it was found that richer media can have significantly positive impacts on decision quality when participants' task-relevant knowledge is high. Moreover, effects of participant deception can be mitigated by employing richer media.									186	0	0	0	2	1	236			0742-1222											SUNY Binghamton, Ctr Leadership Studies, Binghamton, NY 13901 USAUniv Houston, Bauer Coll Business, Dept Informat & Decis Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA				2003-06-01	WOS:000183865800009

Companies have developed entirely new mobility services, and mobility services with pre-digital roots, such as ride-sharing and public transport, have leveraged digitalization to become more convenient to use. Nevertheless, private car use remains the dominant mode of transport in most developed countries, leading to problems such as delays due to traffic congestion, insufficient parking spaces, as well as noise and air pollution. Emerging intermodal mobility ecosystems take advantage of digital advances in mobility services by providing individual, dynamic and context-aware combinations of different mobility services to simplify door-to-door mobility and contribute to the reduction of private car use. However, the service platforms are limited in terms of functional range, for example they may lack integrated ticketing and rely on static data, which makes intermodal mobility inconvenient. This article adopts the service-dominant logic perspective to analyze service ecosystems for intermodal mobility and their service provision. Drawing on traditional institutional literature, the authors question the assumption that service logic is dominant for all actors of a service ecosystem. By applying activity theory, the article illustrates how an institutional logic multiplicity among actors can negatively affect the functional range of service platforms. The results of a qualitative study in Germany show that, in particular, the state logic of some actors, which is characterized by the obligation to provide mobility, impairs the quality of service platforms in supporting citizens in intermodal mobility.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2363-7005	1867-0202										Neu Ulm Univ Appl Sci, Ctr Res Serv Sci, Wileystr 1, D-89231 Neu Ulm, GermanyTech Univ Munich, Chair Informat Syst, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, GermanyNeu Ulm Univ Appl Sci, Wileystr 1, D-89231 Neu Ulm, Germany	Neu Ulm Univ Appl SciNeu Ulm Univ Appl Sci			2020-05-25	WOS:000535383500001

A purposive sample of 12 respondents was interviewed on how they used them in comparison to traditional supportive care. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and interview transcripts using a descriptive interpretive approach.Results: Online communities were used by 31.5%, mostly during treatment (73.9%), daily or weekly (91.3%), primarily for information (91.3%) and symptom management (69.6%) and less for emotional support (47.8%). Reasons for non-use were lack of need (48.0%), self-efficacy (30.0%), trust (24.0%), and awareness (20.0%). Respondents used online communities to address unmet needs during periods of stress and uncertainty. A multi-theory framework helps to explain the conditions influencing their use.Conclusion: Online communities have the potential to fill gaps in supportive care by addressing the unmet needs of a subgroup of breast cancer survivors. Further research is required among typical cancer survivors.Practice implications: Online communities could play an important role as a supplemental resource for a sub-group of breast cancer survivors.

NAS methods have been essential for automating and accelerating the laborious and erroneous process of designing and tuning new Deep Learning (DL) approaches. The past few years have seen increasing number of research works on NAS and associated hyper-parameter optimization (HPO). They have arguably had the biggest influence on classification and object detection tasks, where they have produced state-of-the-art results. Despite the notable success to date, it is still difficult and not always practicable to apply NAS to real-world situations. In general, the structure of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) is too sophisticated to be used in platforms with limited resources, such as IoT, mobile, and embedded systems. In this paper, we revisit several state-of -the-art NAS and HPO methods from a multi-perspective view both in non-federated and distributed federated learning environments. Earlier attempts to critically analyze the compo-nents of NAS or HPO are only limited to non-federated environment, where NAS and HPO related computations need to be performed on a single CPU/ multiple GPUs and where all the data was readily accessible for performing the task of learning. In this article, we extend the discussion and critically analyze the important components of NAS and HPO methods in federated learning environment, where computations need to be performed on multiple computational units in federation and where only local data can be used by a single computational unit. Due to un-availability of entire data in federated learning environment, the earlier NAS methods (i.e., non-federated NAS methods) and the earlier HPO methods (i.e., non-federated HPO methods) cannot be used directly without modifications. We discuss these modifications made by researchers in non-federated NAS and HPO methods to be used in federated learning environment and provide discussion for future avenues.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0045-7906	1879-0755										Jeju Natl Univ, Big Data Res Ctr, Jeju 63243, South KoreaJeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju Si 63243, South KoreaCOMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Comp Sci, Attock Campus, Islamabad 43600, PakistanJeju Natl Univ, Res Inst, Dept Adv Technol, Jeju 63243, South KoreaJeju Natl Univ, Dept Comp Engn, Jeju Si 63243, South Korea				2023-08-25	WOS:001047662200001

The strategic goals, knowledge sourcing practices, and innovation performance of 1257 Belgian firms are investigated. Results show that both social and economic strategic goals are associated with the use of external information sources, but only the pursuit of social goals inspires firms to engage in external collaboration. No evidence is found of an inherent conflict between social and economic strategic goals. Instead, the two types of goals are independent of each other, that is, an emphasis on social goals does not preclude an emphasis on economic goals and vice versa. Moreover, firms' external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance benefit most when strongly held social goals align with strongly held economic goals. These findings offer new insight into the nature and the effects of goal multiplicity among commercial firms. They open up a new perspective on the potential positive effects of the joint pursuit of social and economic strategic goals instead of seeing them as inherently conflicting, as past research has typically done. We illustrate how social strategic goals can deliver unique benefits to a firm, independently of and in addition to economic strategic goals. Our findings also contribute to the open innovation literature by revealing strategic goals as a driver of firms' knowledge sourcing practices. Our findings suggest that solely emphasizing economic goals may be one reason why firms struggle to implement open innovation practices and do not reap their full benefits. The practical implications of our research are discussed.									64	0	0	0	0	1	65			0737-6782	1540-5885										Kings Business Sch, Entrepreneurship, London, EnglandAston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, EnglandUCL, London, EnglandKatholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, BelgiumInt Assoc Appl Psychol, Indianapolis, IN USAUniv Ghent, Entrepreneurship & Strategy, Ghent, BelgiumUniv Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USAAmer Univ Beirut, OSB, Entrepreneurship, Beirut, Lebanon	Kings Business SchInt Assoc Appl Psychol			2019-10-09	WOS:000487845800001		
J	Humes, C; Ou, J; Kumar, PR										The delay of open Markovian queueing networks: Uniform functional bounds, heavy traffic pole multiplicities, and stability								MATHEMATICS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH				22	4			921	954				10.1287/moor.22.4.921							Article	NOV 1997	1997	For open Markovian queueing networks, we study the functional dependence of the mean number in the system (and thus also the mean delay since it is proportional to it by Little's Theorem) on the arrival rate or load factor. We obtain linear programs (LPs) which provide bounds on the pole multiplicity M of the mean number in the system and automatically obtain lower and upper bounds on the coefficients {C-i} of the expansion rho C-M/(1 - rho)(M) + rho CM-1/(1 - rho)(M-1) + ... + rho C-1/(1 - rho) + rho C-0, where rho is the load factor, which are valid for all rho is an element of [0, 1). Our LPs can thus establish the stability of open networks for all arrival rates within capacity, while providing uniformly bounding functional expansions for the mean delay, valid for all arrival rates in the capacity region. The coefficients {C-i} can be optimized to provide the best bound at any desired value of the load factor, while still maintaining its validity for all rho is an element of [0, 1). While the above LPs feature L(L + 1)(M + 1)/2 variables where L is the number of buffers in the network, for balanced systems we further provide a lower dimensional LP featuring just S(S + 1)/2 variables, where S is the number of stations in the network. This bound asymptotically dominates in heavy traffic a bound obtainable from the Pollaczek-Khintchine formula, and can capture interactions between multiple bottleneck stations in heavy traffic. We also provide an explicit upper bound for all scheduling policies in acyclic networks, and for the FBFS policy in open re-entrant lines.									10	0	0	0	0	0	11			0364-765X											NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, FAC BUSINESS ADM, DEPT DECIS SCI, SINGAPORE 117548, SINGAPOREUNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT ELECT & COMP ENGN, URBANA, IL 61801 USAUNIV ILLINOIS, COORDINATED SCI LAB, URBANA, IL 61801 USA				1997-11-01	WOS:A1997YL31600008

The real-time dynamic arrival of orders is a critical issue. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-policy double deep Q-network (MPDDQN) to optimize a Dynamic Multiplicity Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (DMFJSP), in which the dynamic arrival of job orders and multiple types of jobs are considered simultaneously. Specifically, firstly, a mathematical model for DMFJSP is established, and its validity is verified by the Gurobi solver. Secondly, we propose a modified fluid model that transforms discrete scheduling into a continuous flow to simplify the complexity of the DMFJSP. Based on this fluid model, we further develop a multi-metric selection strategy to assist in production scheduling decisions. Third, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model is constructed, we extracted 19 features related to jobs and machines as references for state features and designed 20 composite rules as candidate actions. Subsequently, the MPDDQN algorithm achieves an effective balance between exploration and exploitation across various complex scenarios by combining prioritized experience replay, a soft update mechanism, and an adaptive action selection strategy. Finally, by conducting a comparative analysis with 10 well-known heuristic rules and 3 existing deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling approaches across 81 test cases, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior generalization, robustness, and optimization capabilities in DMFJSP across scenarios with varying levels of complexity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1568-4946	1872-9681										Liaocheng Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Liaocheng 252059, Peoples R ChinaMacau Univ Sci & Technol, Macau Inst Syst Engn, Taipa 999078, Macao, Peoples R ChinaHunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Peoples R China				2025-05-26	WOS:001492671500008

We show how it can be used to improve algorithms in automated storage and retrieval systems. An automated storage and retrieval system includes storage blocks and storage and retrieval machines that either move to retrieve unit loads from their current locations in the system to a depot or take unit loads from a depot and store them to specific locations in the system. Given n storage and retrieval requests in a system with k depots and one storage and retrieval machine, we show that our algorithm for HMATSP-kFVS can solve the problem of minimizing total traveling time of the storage and retrieval machine in O(n(k) + n(3)) time when all depots are specialized (each depot fulfills one type of requests) and in O(n(2k) + n(3)) time when depots are regular (each depot fulfills both types of requests). The best previous algorithm only solves the special case of the problem with 2 regular depots in O(n(6)) time. The applicability of our algorithm for several generalizations and special cases of the problem is also discussed. Furthermore, to evaluate the performance of our solution method, we perform extensive numerical experiments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The competition and risk that now prevail in the sector may require a more refined analysis. We consider a competitive market with agents investing in some mix of capacities: the risk exposure of a plant and the attitude towards risk of the owner depend on the plant and the portfolio of its capacities. They may also depend on hedging contracts acquired by the investor on the market if such contracts exist. We represent these effects through equilibrium models of generation capacity in incomplete markets. The models come in different versions depending on the portfolio of physical plants and hedging contracts. These modify the long-term risk of the plants, the attitude of the owners towards risk, and hence the incentive to invest. The models involve risk-averse producers and consumers, and their behavior is represented by convex risk measures. We use degree theory to prove existence and explore multiplicity of equilibrium solutions.									22	0	0	0	0	0	23			0025-5610	1436-4646										Engie CEEME, Pl Samuel de Champlain 1, F-92930 Paris, FranceEngie CEEME, Blvd Simon Bolivar 34, B-1000 Brussels, BelgiumCatholic Univ Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Voie du Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium				2017-11-03	WOS:000411225100002

While general advice on the design and analysis of neutral benchmark studies can be found in recent literature, a certain flexibility always exists. This includes the choice of data sets and performance measures, the handling of missing performance values, and the way the performance values are aggregated over the data sets. As a consequence of this flexibility, researchers may be concerned about how their choices affect the results or, in the worst case, may be tempted to engage in questionable research practices (e.g., the selective reporting of results or the post hoc modification of design or analysis components) to fit their expectations. To raise awareness for this issue, we use an example benchmark study to illustrate how variable benchmark results can be when all possible combinations of a range of design and analysis options are considered. We then demonstrate how the impact of each choice on the results can be assessed using multidimensional unfolding. In conclusion, based on previous literature and on our illustrative example, we claim that the multiplicity of design and analysis options combined with questionable research practices lead to biased interpretations of benchmark results and to over-optimistic conclusions. This issue should be considered by computational researchers when designing and analyzing their benchmark studies and by the scientific community in general in an effort towards more reliable benchmark results.

In this paper, a new mathematical model of buoyancy pressure ventilation for two vertically connected open cavities is presented. Compared with the previous published papers studying two vertically connected open cavities with equal heights and hot source E-2 < 0 in the upper room, we study two vertically connected open cavities with unequal heights and hot source E-2 < 0 or E-2 > 0 in the upper room. By solving and analyzing the equilibrium points and characteristic roots of the differential equations, we analyze the stability of two systems with upward flow pattern and downward pattern and obtain the criteria to determine the stability and existence of solutions for two scenarios. According to these criteria, the multiple steady states of buoyancy ventilation in two vertically connected open cavities with unequal heights and variable strength of hot sources can be obtained. These criteria can be used to design buoyancy ventilation or natural exhaust ventilation systems in two vertically connected open cavities. Compared with two stable states of buoyancy ventilation existing in two vertically connected open cavities with equal heights in the previously published papers, we find that more stable states and unstable states of buoyancy ventilation exist in two vertically connected open cavities with unequal heights in our paper. Finally, bifurcation diagrams and the phase portraits for the two scenarios are given.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526										Hunan Univ, Sch Architecture, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China				2020-08-19	WOS:000556230800004

In this paper, a four-zone model of buoyancy ventilation in typical underground building is proposed. The underground structure is divided to four zones, a differential equation is established in each zone, and therefore, there are four differential equations in the underground structure. By solving and analyzing the equilibrium points and characteristic roots of the differential equations, we analyze the stability of three scenarios and obtain the criterions to determine the stability and existence of solutions for two scenarios. According to these criterions, the multiple steady states of buoyancy ventilation in any four-zone underground buildings for different stack height ratios and the strength ratios of the heat sources can be obtained. These criteria can be used to design buoyancy ventilation or natural exhaust ventilation systems in underground buildings. Compared with the two-zone model in (Liu et al. 2020), the results of the proposed four-zone model are more consistent with CFD results in (Liu et al. 2018). In addition, the results of proposed four-zone model are more specific and more detailed in the unstable equilibrium point interval. We find that the unstable equilibrium point interval is divided into two different subintervals corresponding to the saddle point of index 2 and the saddle focal equilibrium point of index 2, respectively. Finally, the phase portraits and vector field diagrams for the two scenarios are given.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526										Hunan Univ, Sch Architecture, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China				2020-10-06	WOS:000571901400005

This field has garnered significant attention due to its potential to reshape decision-making processes within supply chains. At the same time, the practical side of supply chain operations remains intensely competitive in today's business landscape. Furthermore, the current academic research aims to outline effective strategies for achieving sustainability across supply chains, particularly in the manufacturing sector. In response to these challenges, this research has conducted an integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach to evaluate sustainable supply chain performance from the triple bottom line perspective, including financial, environmental, and social performance.Design/methodology/approach - The initial stage involves selecting the crucial criteria (short-term and long-term) and alternatives for sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP) from experts and conducting an in-depth literature review. Initially, there were 17 criteria, but after a pilot test with co-authors and online discussions with experts, the number of criteria was subsequently reduced to 9. In the second phase, the Best-Worst Method (BWM) was applied to rank and prioritize the criteria. The third and final stage examined the causal relationship between the identified criteria, utilizing the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique.Findings - Based on BWM analysis results, the top three criteria in terms of prominence are: (1) return on investment (ROI), (2) product quality, and (3) manufacturing lead time. Out of the three alternatives, financial performance (FP) is the most crucial dimension for SSCP, followed by environmental performance (ENP) and social performance (SP). On the other hand, the DEMATEL approach showed that work health and safety (short-term criterion), asset utilization (long-term criterion), energy consumption (long-term criterion), waste disposal (long-term criterion), manufacturing lead time (short-term criterion), and on-time delivery (short-term criterion) are categorized within the cause group, while criteria such as return on investment (ROI) (long-term criterion), customer-service level (short-term criterion), and product quality (long-term criterion) fall into the effect group.Research limitations/implications - The proposed study has certain drawbacks that pave the way for future research directions. First, it is worth noting the need for a larger sample size to ensure the reliability of results, the potential inclusion of additional criteria to enhance the assessment of sustainability performance, and the consideration of a qualitative approach to gain deeper insights into the outcomes. In addition, fuzziness in qualitative subjective perception could be imperative when collecting data to ensure its reliability, as translating experts' perceptions into exact numerical values can be challenging because human perceptions often carry elements of uncertainty or vagueness. Therefore, fuzzy integrated MCDM frameworks are better suited for future research to handle the uncertainties involved in human perceptions, making it a more appropriate approach for decision-making in scenarios where traditional MCDM methods may prove insufficient.Practical implications - The proposed framework will enable decision-makers to gain deeper insights into how various decision criteria impact SSCP, thus providing a comprehensive evaluation of SSCP that considers multiple dimensions, such as financial, environmental, and social performance within the manufacturing sector.Originality/value - The proposed study is the first empirical study to integrate both BWM and DEMATEL approaches to evaluate sustainable supply chain performance in the manufacturing context.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1741-0401	1758-6658										Abdelmalek Essaadi Univ, Fac Sci & Tech, Dept Mech Engn, Tangier, Morocco				2024-07-04	WOS:001255590700001		
J	Ding, Chao; Feng, Guangcai; Xiong, Zhiqiang; Zhang, Lu					Zhang, Lu/0000-0002-5384-7630					Ground Subsidence, Driving Factors, and Risk Assessment of the Photovoltaic Power Generation and Greenhouse Planting (PPG&GP) Projects in Coal-Mining Areas of Xintai City Observed from a Multi-Temporal InSAR Perspective								REMOTE SENSING				16	6					1109			10.3390/rs16061109							Article	MAR 2024	2024	In recent years, photovoltaic power generation and greenhouse planting (PPG&GP) have become effective approaches for reconstructing and restoring the ecological environment of old coal-mining industry bases, such as Xintai City. However, the ecological impacts or improvements of the PPG&GP projects and their daily operations on the local environment are still unclear. To solve these problems, this study retrieved the ground deformation velocities and time series of the study region by performing the Small-Baseline Subset (SBAS)-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR and Sentinel-1 SAR datasets. With these deformation results, the spatial analysis indicated that the area of the subsidence region within the PPG&GP projects reached 10.70 km(2), with a magnitude of approximately -21.61 +/- 12.10 mm/yr. Also, even though the ground deformations and their temporal changes were both visible in the construction and operation stages of the PPG&GP projects, the temporal analysis demonstrated that most observation points finally entered into the stationary phases in the late stage of the observation period. This phenomenon validated the effectiveness of the PPG&GP projects in enhancing the ground surface stability in coal-mining areas. Additionally, the precipitation, geological structure, increased coal-mining depths, and emergent agricultural modes were assumed to be the major impact factors controlling the ground deformation within the local PPG&GP projects. Finally, a novel risk assessment method with a designed index of IRA was utilized to classify the ground subsidence risks of the PPG&GP projects into three levels: Low (69.7%), Medium (16.9%), and High (9.4%). This study sheds a bright light on the ecological monitoring and risk management of the burgeoning industrial and agricultural infrastructures, such as the PPG&GP projects, constructed upon the traditional coal-mining areas in China from a multi-temporal InSAR perspective.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2072-4292										Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn & Geomat, Zibo 255049, Peoples R ChinaWuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & Re, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R ChinaChinese Acad Sci, Innovat Acad Precis Measurement Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Geodesy & Earths Dynam, Wuhan 430077, Peoples R ChinaCent South Univ, Sch Geosci & Infophys, Changsha 410083, Peoples R China				2024-04-05	WOS:001193485400001

In this paper, we study the asymptotic average number of different types of trapping sets such as elementary TSs (ETS), leafless ETSs (LETS), absorbing sets (ABS), elementary ABSs (EABS), and stopping sets (SS), in random variable-regular and irregular LDPC code ensembles. We demonstrate that, regardless of the type of the TS, as the code's length tends to infinity, the average number of a given structure tends to infinity, to a positive constant, or to zero, if the structure contains no cycle, only one cycle, or more than one cycle, respectively. For the case where the structure contains a single cycle, we derive the asymptotic expected multiplicity of the structure by counting the average number of its constituent cycles and all the possible ways that the structure can be constructed from the cycle. This, in general, involves computing the expected number of cycles of a certain length with a certain given combination of node degrees, or computing the expected number of cycles of a certain length expanded to the desired structure by the connection of trees to its nodes. The asymptotic results obtained in this work, which are independent of the block length and only depend on the code's degree distributions, are shown to be accurate even for finite-length codes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0018-9448	1557-9654										Carleton Univ, Dept Syst & Comp Engn, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada				2019-10-09	WOS:000487041200004

To determine the yield of SSBs, G(ssb), by this method, it is commonly assumed that Poisson statistics apply such that, on average, one SSB occurs per supercoiled plasmid lost. For the direct effect, at a large enough plasmid size, this assumption may be invalid. In this report, the assumption that one SSB occurs per pUC18 plasmid (2686 bp) is tested by measuring free base release (fbr), which is also a measure of deoxyribose damage in films prepared under controlled relative humidity so as to produce known levels of DNA hydration. The level of DNA hydration, F, is expressed in mol water/mol nucleotide. The yield of free base release, G(fbr), was measured by HPLC after exposure of the films to 70 kV X rays and subsequent dissolution in water. It is well known that damage in deoxyribose leads to SSBs and free base release. Based on known mechanisms, there exists a close correspondence between free base release and SSBs, i.e., G(fbr) congruent to G(ssb). Following this assumption, the SSB multiplicity, m(ssb), was determined, where m(ssb) was defined as the mean number of SSBs per supercoiled plasmid lost. The yield of lost supercoil was determined previously (S. Purkayastha et al., J. Phys. Chem. B 110, 26286-26291, 2006). We found that m(ssb) = 1.4 +/- 0.2 at Gamma = 2.5 and m(ssb) = 2.8 +/- 0.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.5 at Gamma = 22.5, indicating that the assumption of one SSB per lost supercoil is not likely to hold for a 2686-bp plasmid exposed to the direct effect. In addition, an increase in G(fbr), upon stepping from Gamma = 2.5 to Gamma = 22.5, was paralleled by an increase in the yield of trapped deoxyribose radicals, G(dRib)(fr), also measured previously. As a consequence, the shortfall between SSBs and trapped radicals, G(diff) = G(ssb) -G(dRib)(fr), remained relatively constant at 90-110 nmol/J. The lack of change between the two extremes of hydration is in keeping with the suggestion that non-radical species, such as doubly oxidized deoxyribose, are responsible for the shortfall.

The highly expressed microRNAs in the skin are of great significance for skin development. The purpose of the investigation was to explore the effect and mechanism of miR-211 on inflammation, oxidative stress, and migration in keratinocytes. Methods: The HaCaT keratinocytes were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to establish a wound-healing model. The expression of miR-211 was examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The cell function was reflected in proliferative ability, migration, apoptosis, and inflammation, which were evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, transwell test, flow cytometry technique, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The target of miR-211 was verified by luciferase luminescence measurements. Results: H2O2 inhibited HaCaT cell proliferation, migration, and promoted cell apoptosis, accompanied with the downregulation of miR-211. H2O2 led to inflammatory response and oxidative damage to HaCaT. miR-211 promoted proliferation and migration but improved cell apoptosis of HaCaT. The role of H2O2 on inflammatory response and oxidative stress was alleviated by miR-211. SRY-box transcription factor 11 (SOX11) was a targeted mediator of miR-211. SOX11 reversed the influence of miR-211 on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. Conclusion: miR-211 regulated the proliferation, migration, apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress of keratinocytes by mediating SOX11, thus participating in cutaneous wound healing.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1660-5527	1660-5535										Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Huaian TCM Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Huaian, Peoples R ChinaHubei Univ Chinese Med, Clin Coll 1, Wuhan, Peoples R ChinaShijiazhuang Hosp Tradit Chinese Med, Dept Vasculator, Shijiazhuang, Peoples R ChinaHuailai Shiji Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Zhangjiakou, Peoples R ChinaNanjing Univ, JinLing Hosp, Affiliated Hosp, Med Sch,Dept Dermatol, Nanjing, Peoples R China	Shijiazhuang Hosp Tradit Chinese MedHuailai Shiji Hosp			2025-02-26	WOS:001426739600001	39870063

Of the participants, two were females and 21 were males. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data.Results: Three key themes emerged: 1) Multifaceted perspectives on MWUD. Participants viewed MWUD as offenders, victims, and patients. 2) Dynamic interactions with MWUD. Relationships were characterized as either adversarial or supportive, influenced by participants' personalities, experiences, beliefs, workload, and psychological training. 3) Advocating for punitive measures in drug rehabilitation. While the participants generally favored strict penalties for MWUD, they acknowledged the value of community-based rehabilitation. Concerns about social stigma, privacy, motivation, and the costs of voluntary rehabilitation tempered their support.Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of raising awareness and challenging bias among police officers. It emphasizes the need for psychological training to enhance their capacity to provide humane care and foster positive interactions with MWUD. Additionally, ensuring access to affordable, accessible, and stigma-free voluntary rehabilitation is crucial for effective drug rehabilitation efforts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0095-2990	1097-9891										China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Metropolitan Univ, Sch Nursing & Hlth Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R ChinaHong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Sociol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China				2025-02-03	WOS:001407047100001	39868983

In order to explore related mechanisms, establishing multiple systems coupled with tremendous exit dynamics and studying their exit dynamics properties are quite vital. Beyond previous researches, new stochastic transport processes are emphasized here. Multiple new exit dynamic systems are established, which are motivated by the multiplicity of paths and products of real biochemical processes in organisms. In order to ensure research universality, core system modeling factors are fully considered. Countable parallel orbits, uniform connection with external sources, countable parallel orbits as subsystems in middle lattices and influences of all lattices on transport trajectories on dynamic properties are analyzed. Dynamic properties of different particles located in orbits are explored by deeply studying average exit time and time scale. Quantitative spatiotemporal impacts are extensively studied. The rationality of average exit time as a time scale in the universal exit dynamic system is proved. Main findings and fruitful results can not only serve as theoretical bases for broadening reaction path modeling, but also be helpful to support understanding nonequilibrium transport mechanisms, especially stochastic biochemical processes.									30	6	0	0	1	0	31			0217-9792	1793-6578										Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Mech Engn, Hefei 230009, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Sch Life Sci, Hefei 230027, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Hefei 230027, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei 230026, Peoples R ChinaUniv Sci & Technol China, Dept Modern Phys, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China				2024-02-11	WOS:001000815500003
