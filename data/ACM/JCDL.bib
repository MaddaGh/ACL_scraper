abstract = {Multiple diagram navigation (MDN) uses multiple diagrams, maps, or charts to navigate a document collection. To support exploratory search scenarios, MDN provides unconventional overviews for the content and introduces novel navigational queries. In a Diagram-to-Content query, a user clicks on diagram elements to retrieve related collection documents. Diagram-to-Diagram queries allows users to select diagram element(s) to see related elements highlighted in other diagrams. Content-to-Diagram queries highlight diagram elements related to document(s) selected by the user. MDN depends on manually created connections between diagram elements and collection documents. Therefore, only a small portion of the targeted collection might be accessible from the diagrams. In this paper, we extend the domain of MDN diagram-to-content queries to reach related collection documents not directly connected to the diagrams. We focus on Wikipedia as a case study and a class of diagrams with specific characteristics. We exploit the Wikipedia hyperlink graph and internal diagram structures to provide a diagram-influenced ranking of Wikipedia pages. We tested different settings for our ranking algorithm using 12 diagrams from six domains. The results showed the strong influence of diagrams on ranking and reasonably high similarity between diagram elements selected by the user and the top-10-ranked pages.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for identifying the same records across multiple databases in different languages. In order to identify the same records, we calculate the similarities between records by comparing the text values of metadata elements. The proposed method, i.e. finding the same records across multiple databases, will help users to know which organization has a certain record and its customized versions regardless of languages and differences in formats. Although the proposed approach was demonstrated on Japanese Ukiyo-e databases, it might be applicable to other disciplines for bridging the gaps between databases in different languages.},

abstract = {The impact of scientific research has traditionally been quantified using productivity indices such as the well-known h-index. On the other hand, different research fields---in fact, even different research areas within a single field---may have very different publishing patterns, which may not be well described by a single, global index. In this paper, we argue that productivity indices should account for the singularities of the publication patterns of different research areas, in order to produce an unbiased assessment of the impact of scientific research. Inspired by ranking aggregation approaches in distributed information retrieval, we propose a novel approach for ranking researchers across multiple research areas. Our approach is generic and produces cross-area versions of any global productivity index, such as the volume of publications, citation count and even the h-index. Our thorough evaluation considering multiple areas within the broad field of Computer Science shows that our cross-area indices outperform their global counterparts when assessed against the official ranking produced by CNPq, the Brazilian National Research Council for Scientific and Technological Development. As a result, this paper contributes a valuable mechanism to support the decisions of funding bodies and research agencies, for example, in any research assessment effort.},

abstract = {Silver is an authoring tool that aims to allow novice users to edit di gital video. The goal is to make editing of digital video as easy as text editing. Silver provides multiple coordinated views, including project, source, outline, subject, storyboard, textual transcript and timeline views. Selections and edits in any view are synchronized with all other views. A variety of recognition algorithms are applied to the video and audio content and then are used to aid in the editing tasks. The Informedia Digital Library supplies the recognition algorithms and metadata used to support intelligent editing, and Informedia also provides search and a repository. The metadata includes shot boundaries and a time-synchronized transcript, which are used to support intelligent selection and intelligent cut/copy/paste.},

abstract = {Individual optical character recognition (OCR) engines vary in the types of errors they commit in recognizing text, particularly poor quality text. By aligning the output of multiple OCR engines and taking advantage of the differences between them, the error rate based on the aligned lattice of recognized words is significantly lower than the individual OCR word error rates. This lattice error rate constitutes a lower bound among aligned alternatives from the OCR output. Results from a collection of poor quality mid-twentieth century typewritten documents demonstrate an average reduction of 55.0% in the error rate of the lattice of alternatives and a realized word error rate (WER) reduction of 35.8% in a dictionary-based selection process. As an important precursor, an innovative admissible heuristic for the A* algorithm is developed, which results in a significant reduction in state space exploration to identify all optimal alignments of the OCR text output, a necessary step toward the construction of the word hypothesis lattice. On average 0.0079% of the state space is explored to identify all optimal alignments of the documents.},

Using more than one representation of the images in a collection can improve the results presented to a user without changing the underlying feature extraction or search technologies. We present an example of this "multiple viewpoint" approach, multiple image channels, and discuss its advantages for an image-seeking user. This approach has also been shown to dramatically improve retrieval effectiveness in content-based image retrieval systems[3].},

abstract = {With the amount of digitalized documents increasing exponentially, it is more difficult for users to keep up to date with the knowledge in their domain. In this paper, we present a framework named IFME (Information Filtering by Multiple Examples) in a digital library environment to help users identify the literature related to their interests by leveraging the Positive Unlabeled learning (PU learning). Using a few relevant documents provided by a user and considering the documents in an online database as unlabeled data (called U), it ranks the documents in U using a PU learning algorithm. From the experimental results, we found that while the approach performed well when a large set of relevant feedback documents were available, it performed relatively poor when the relevant feedback documents were few. We improved IFME by combining PU learning with under-sampling to tune the performance. Using Mean Average Precision (MAP), our experimental results indicated that with under-sampling, the performance improved significantly even when the size of P was small. We believe the PU learning based IFME framework brings insights to develop more effective digital library systems.},

abstract = {Scientific knowledge graphs have been proposed as a solution to structure the content of research publications in a machine-actionable way and enable more efficient, computer-assisted workflows for many research activities. Crowd-sourcing approaches are used frequently to build and maintain such scientific knowledge graphs. To contribute to scientific knowledge graphs, researchers need simple and easy-to-use solutions to generate new knowledge graph elements and establish the practice of semantic representations in scientific communication. In this paper, we present a workflow for authors of scientific documents to specify their contributions with a LATEX package, called SciKGTeX, and upload them to a scientific knowledge graph. The SciKGTeX package allows authors of scientific publications to mark the main contributions of their work directly in LATEX source files. The package embeds marked contributions as metadata into the generated PDF document, from where they can be extracted automatically and imported into a scientific knowledge graph, such as the ORKG. This workflow is simpler and faster than current approaches, which make use of external web interfaces for data entry. Our user evaluation shows that SciKGTeX is easy to use, with a score of 79 out of 100 on the System Usability Scale, as participants of the study needed only 7 minutes on average to annotate the main contributions on a sample abstract of a published paper. Further testing shows that the embedded contributions can be successfully uploaded to ORKG within ten seconds. SciKGTeX simplifies the process of manual semantic annotation of research contributions in scientific articles. Our workflow demonstrates how a scientific knowledge graph can automatically ingest research contributions from document metadata.},
