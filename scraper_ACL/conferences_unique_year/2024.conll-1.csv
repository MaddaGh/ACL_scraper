Historically, techniques in this area have been unsupervised, with more success recently coming from supervised methods instead. Although these approaches see better performance, they require training data and upfront training time. We propose a new method called Coherence, where we use strong sentence embeddings to pull representational keywords as the main constructor of sentences when comparing them to one another. Additionally, we include a storage of previously found keywords for the purposes of creating a more accurate segment representation instead of just the immediate sentence in question. With our system, we show improved results over current state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques when analyzed using Pk and WindowDiff scores. Because its unsupervised, Coherence requires no fine-tuning."

These abilities may be driven by mechanisms based on acquired grammatical rules that compose abstract syntactic-semantic structures within utterances. Segments without syntactic and semantic significance are consistently disregarded in these structures. The structures, in tandem with lexis, likely underpin language comprehension and thus facilitate effective communication.In our study, grounded in linguistically motivated experiments, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively perform analogical speech comprehension tasks. In particular, we examine the ability of LLMs to extract well-structured utterances from transcriptions of noisy dialogues. We conduct two evaluation experiments in the Polish language scenario, using a dataset presumably unfamiliar to LLMs to mitigate the risk of data contamination. Our results show that not all extracted utterances are correctly structured, indicating that either LLMs do not fully acquire syntactic-semantic rules or they acquire them but cannot apply them effectively. We conclude that the ability of LLMs to comprehend noisy utterances is still relatively superficial compared to human proficiency in processing them."

The study of norm discovery has seen significant development over the last few years, with various interesting approaches. However, it is difficult to adopt these approaches to discover norms in a new culture, as they rely either on human annotations or real-world dialogue contents. This paper presents a robust automatic norm discovery pipeline, which utilizes the cultural knowledge of GPT-3.5 Turbo (ChatGPT) along with several social factors. By using these social factors and ChatGPT, our pipeline avoids the use of human dialogues that tend to be limited to specific scenarios, as well as the use of human annotations that make it difficult and costly to enlarge the dataset. The resulting database - Multi-cultural Norm Base (MNB) - covers 6 distinct cultures, with over 150k sociocultural norm statements in total. A state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 3, fine-tuned with our proposed dataset, shows remarkable results on various downstream tasks, outperforming models fine-tuned on other datasets significantly."

Pruning, as an effective method, can significantly reduce inference costs. However, current pruning algorithms for encoder-based language models often focus on locally optimal solutions, neglecting a comprehensive exploration of the global solution space. This oversight can lead to instability in the solution process, thereby affecting the overall performance of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a structured pruning algorithm named G-Pruner (Global Pruner), comprising two integral components: PPOM (Proximal Policy Optimization Mask) and CG²MT (Conjugate Gradient Squared Mask Tuning), utilizing a global optimization strategy. This strategy not only eliminates the need for retraining but also ensures the algorithm’s stability and adaptability to environmental changes, effectively addressing the issue of focusing solely on immediate optima while neglecting long-term effects. This method is evaluated on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks using BERTBASE and DistilBERT models. The experimental results indicate that without any retraining, G-Pruner achieves significant accuracy improvements on the SQuAD2.0 task with a FLOPs constraint of 60%, demonstrating a 6.02% increase in F1 score compared with baseline algorithms."

In this report, we investigated how the ability of language models to retrieve arbitrary in-context nouns developed during training (across time) and as language models trained on the same dataset increase in size (across scale). We then asked whether learning of in-context retrieval correlates with learning of more challenging zero-shot benchmarks. Furthermore, inspired by semantic effects in human short-term memory, we evaluated the retrieval with respect to a major semantic component of target nouns, namely whether they denote a concrete or abstract entity, as rated by humans. We show that verbatim in-context retrieval developed in a sudden transition early in the training process, after about 1% of the training tokens. This was observed across model sizes (from 14M and up to 12B parameters), and the transition occurred slightly later for the two smallest models. We further found that the development of verbatim in-context retrieval is positively correlated with the learning of zero-shot benchmarks. Around the transition point, all models showed the advantage of retrieving concrete nouns as opposed to abstract nouns. In all but two smallest models, the advantage dissipated away toward the end of training."

This work introduces EditEval: An instruction-based, benchmark and evaluation suite that leverages high-quality existing and new datasets in English for the automatic evaluation of editing capabilities, such as making text more cohesive and paraphrasing. We evaluate several pre-trained models, which shows that InstructGPT and PEER on average perform the best, but that most baselines fall below the supervised state-of-the-art, particularly when neutralizing and updating information. Our analysis also shows that commonly used metrics for editing tasks do not always correlate well, and that prompts leading to the strongest performance do not necessarily elicit strong performance across different models. Through the release of this benchmark (code and data available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/EditEval) and a publicly available leaderboard challenge, we hope to unlock future work on developing models more capable of controllable and iterative editing."

This problem is commonly tackled by continually pre-training and fine-tuning these models for said languages. A significant issue in this process is the limited vocabulary coverage in the original model’s tokenizer, leading to inadequate representation of new languages and necessitating an expansion of the tokenizer. The initialization of the embeddings corresponding to new vocabulary items presents a further challenge. Current strategies require cross-lingual embeddings and lack a solid theoretical foundation as well as comparisons with strong baselines. In this paper, we first establish theoretically that initializing within the convex hull of existing embeddings is a good initialization, followed by a novel but simple approach, Constrained Word2Vec (CW2V), which does not require cross-lingual embeddings. Our study evaluates different initialization methods for expanding RoBERTa and LLaMA 2 across four languages and five tasks. The results show that CW2V performs equally well or even better than more advanced techniques. Additionally, simpler approaches like multivariate initialization perform on par with these advanced methods indicating that efficient large-scale multilingual continued pretraining can be achieved even with simpler initialization methods."

Thus, in this work we investigate two complementary methods to create such a resource: (i) instantiating CQs templates as defined by Walton’s argumentation theory and (ii), using LLMs as CQs generators. By doing so, we contribute with a procedure to establish what is a valid CQ and conclude that, while LLMs are reasonable CQ generators, they still have a wide margin for improvement in this task."

To evaluate and address the core challenge, we propose a new task formulation of the information updating task that only requires the provision of an unstructured updating corpus and evaluates the performance of information updating on the generalizability to question-answer pairs pertaining to the updating information.We further propose a novel and effective pipeline approach for the task, highlighting a self-prompting-based question-answer generation process and a associative distillation methods to bridge the LM-logical discrepancy.We develop two datasets for evaluation, one sourced from news articles published in March and April 2023, and the other from the Natural Questions benchmark.Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, significantly increasing the factual consistency score (on a scale from 0 to 1) by up to 0.16.

We show that the simple perturbation-based method of Causal ATE removes this unintended effect. Specifically, we ground it in the problem of toxicity mitigation, where a significant challenge lies in the inadvertent bias that often emerges towards protected groups post detoxification. We show that this unintended bias can be solved by the use of the Causal ATE metric.

Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has been a long-standing NLP problem, which has given rise to many evaluation datasets and models over the decades. Recently the emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) raises much hope in improving accuracy. In this work, we evaluate word sense disambiguation capabilities of four LLMs: OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3.5, Mistral’s 7b parameter model, Meta’s Llama 70b, and Google’s Gemini Pro. We evaluate many well-established datasets containing a variety of texts and senses on these. After observing the performances of some datasets, we selectively study some failure cases and identify the reasons for failures. We explore human judgments that would correct these failures. Our findings suggest that many failure cases are related to a lack of world knowledge and the reasoning to amalgamate this knowledge rather than the lack of linguistic knowledge. We categorize the judgments so that the next generation of LLMs can improve by incorporating deeper world knowledge and reasoning. We conclude that word sense disambiguation could serve as a guide for probing the reasoning power of LLMs to measure their functional competency. We also list the accuracy of these datasets. We find that on many occasions, accuracy drops to below 70%, which is much less than that of well-performing existing models."

Larger texts require preprocessing with significant information loss through paraphrasing or multi-step decomposition. This paper introduces AIStorySimilarity, a novel benchmark to measure the semantic distance between long-text stories based on core structural elements drawn from narrative theory and script writing. Based on four narrative elements (characters, plot, setting, and themes) as well 31 sub-features within these, we use a SOTA LLM (gpt-3.5-turbo) to extract and evaluate the semantic similarity of a diverse set of major Hollywood movies. In addition, we compare human evaluation with story similarity scores computed three ways: extracting elements from film scripts before evaluation (Elements), directly evaluating entire scripts (Scripts), and extracting narrative elements from the parametric memory of SOTA LLMs without any provided scripts (GenAI). To the best of our knowledge, AIStorySimilarity is the first benchmark to measure long-text story similarity using a comprehensive approach to narrative theory.

By generating and testing priming predictions from competing theoretical accounts, we can infer which assumptions from syntactic theory are useful for characterizing the representations humans build when processing sentences. As a case study, we use SPAWN to generate priming predictions from two theories (Whiz-Deletion and Participial-Phase) which make different assumptions about the structure of English relative clauses. By modulating the reanalysis mechanism that the parser uses and strength of the parser’s prior knowledge, we generated nine sets of predictions from each of the two theories. Then, we tested these predictions using a novel web-based comprehension-to-production priming paradigm. We found that while the some of the predictions from the Participial-Phase theory aligned with human behavior, none of the predictions from the the Whiz-Deletion theory did, thus suggesting that the Participial-Phase theory might better characterize human relative clause representations."

In this paper, we propose an iterative autoregressive summarization paradigm - IARSum, which fuses the learning of triplet relations into a GL framework and further enhances summarization performance. Specifically, IARSum develops a dual-encoder network to enable the simultaneous input of a document and its candidate (or reference) summary. On this basis, it learns to 1) model the relative semantics defined over tuples (candidate, document) and (reference, document) respectively and balance them; 2) reduce lexical differences between candidate and reference summaries. Furthermore, IARSum iteratively reprocesses a generated candidate at inference time to ground higher quality.

Using standard regime-agnostic surprisal estimates we find that the prediction of surprisal theory regarding the presence of a linear effect of surprisal on processing times, extends to these regimes. However, when using surprisal estimates from regime-specific contexts that match the contexts and tasks given to humans, we find that in information seeking, such estimates do not improve the predictive power of processing times compared to standard surprisals. Further, regime-specific contexts yield near zero surprisal estimates with no predictive power for processing times in repeated reading. These findings point to misalignments of task and memory representations between humans and current language models, and question the extent to which such models can be used for estimating cognitively relevant quantities.

Recently, several studies examined whether the models demonstrate patterns similar to humans and whether they are sensitive to the phenomena of interference like humans’ grammaticality judgements, including the phenomenon of agreement attraction.In this paper, we probe BERT and GPT models on the syntactic phenomenon of agreement attraction in Russian using the psycholinguistic data with syncretism. Working on the language with syncretism between some plural and singular forms allows us to differentiate between the effects of the surface form and of the underlying grammatical feature. Thus we can further investigate models’ sensitivity to this phenomenon and examine if the patterns of their behaviour are similar to human patterns. Moreover, we suggest a new way of comparing models’ and humans’ responses via statistical testing. We show that there are some similarities between models’ and humans’ results, while GPT is somewhat more aligned with human responses than BERT. Finally, preliminary results suggest that surface form syncretism influences attraction, perhaps more so than grammatical form syncretism."

In this paper, we challenge the conventional view by investigating whether structure dependence realizes efficient communication, focusing on coordinate structures.We design three types of artificial languages: (i) one with a structure-dependent reduction operation, which is similar to natural language, (ii) one without any reduction operations, and (iii) one with a linear (rather than structure-dependent) reduction operation.We quantify the communicative efficiency of these languages.The results demonstrate that the language with the structure-dependent reduction operation is significantly more communicatively efficient than the counterfactual languages.This suggests that the existence of structure-dependent properties can be explained from the perspective of efficient communication."

Our results show that removing uncertainty disrupts the observed effect. The experiments suggest the fan effect is consistent whether the fan value is induced in-context or in the pre-training data. Finally, these findings provide in-silico evidence that fan effects and typicality are expressions of the same phenomena."

Overtly complex multimodal models are prone to overfitting on in-domain data, which hampers their performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address these issues, we propose Continuous Attentive Multimodal Prompt Tuning model (CAMP), that leverages the prompt tuning paradigm to handle few-shot multimodal sarcasm detection. To overcome the siloed learning process of continuous prompt tokens, we design a novel, continuous multimodal attentive prompt where the continuous tokens intricately engage with both image and text tokens, enabling the assimilation of knowledge from different input modalities. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms other multimodal baseline methods in the few-shot setting and OOD scenarios."

Through few-shot fine-tuning, we demonstrate improvement in affordance knowledge in PTLMs and VLMs. Our research contributes a novel dataset for language grounding tasks, and presents insights into LM capabilities, advancing the understanding of object affordances."

In particular, we are interested in discovering whether language models recognise metaphorical analogies equally well as other types of analogies, and whether the model size has an impact on this ability. The results show that there are relevant differences using perplexity as a proxy, with the larger models reducing the gap when it comes to analogical processing, and for distinguishing metaphors from incorrect analogies. This behaviour does not result in increased difficulties for larger generative models in identifying metaphors in comparison to other types of analogies from anomalous sentences in a zero-shot generation setting, when perplexity values of metaphoric and non-metaphoric analogies are similar."

In this study, aiming to further compress PLMs reduced by the generic techniques, we exploit frequency-aware sparse coding to compress the embedding layers of the PLMs fine-tuned to downstream tasks. To minimize the impact of the compression on the accuracy, we retain the embeddings of common tokens as they are and use them to reconstruct embeddings of rare tokens by locally linear mapping.

LLMs on the other hand have a rich reservoir of cultural knowledge embedded within its parameters that can be potentially exploited for such applications. In this paper, we define the task of cultural adaptation and create an evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of modern LLMs for cultural adaptation and analyze their cross-cultural knowledge while connecting related concepts across different cultures. We also analyze possible issues with automatic adaptation. We hope that this task will offer more insight into the cultural understanding of LLMs and their creativity in cross-cultural scenarios."

We posed two (research) questions, considering three sentiment datasets in two different domains – movie and product reviews. Evaluators with two different backgrounds evaluated documents by comparing the predominant sentiment assigned by the model to the label in the gold dataset in order to decide on a likely misclassification reason. Based on a high inter-evaluator agreement (81.7%), we observed significant differences between the product and movie review domains, such as the prevalence of ambivalence in product reviews and sarcasm in movie reviews. Our analysis also revealed an unexpectedly high rate of incorrect labeling in the gold dataset (up to 33%) and a significant amount of incorrect prediction by the model due to a series of linguistic phenomena (including amplified words, contrastive markers, comparative sentences, and references to world knowledge). Overall, our taxonomy and methodology allow us to explain between 80%-85% of the errors with high confidence (agreement) – enabling us to point out where future efforts to improve models should be concentrated."

However, to date, this work has exclusively involved unimodal (language-only) comprehension data, whereas much human language use takes place in rich multimodal contexts. Here we extend psychometric benchmarking to visual language models (VLMs). We develop a novel experimental paradigm, Image-Conditioned Maze Reading, in which participants first view an image and then read a text describing an image within the Maze paradigm, yielding word-by-word reaction-time measures with high signal-to-noise ratio and good localization of expectation-driven language processing effects. We find a large facilitatory effect of correct image context on language comprehension, not only for words such as concrete nouns that are directly grounded in the image but even for ungrounded words in the image descriptions. Furthermore, we find that VLM surprisal captures most to all of this effect. We use these findings to benchmark a range of VLMs, showing that models with lower perplexity generally have better psychometric performance, but that among the best VLMs tested perplexity and psychometric performance dissociate. Overall, our work offers new possibilities for connecting psycholinguistics with multimodal LLMs for both scientific and engineering goals."

This lack of cognitively-aware personalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in educational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of individual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly relevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based Learning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the Instance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric is beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints in a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making.
