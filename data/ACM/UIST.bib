abstract = {We propose a novel multi-perspective multi-layer interaction using a mobile device, which provides an immersive experience of 3D navigation through an object. The mobile device serves as a window, through which the user can observe the object in detail from various perspectives by orienting the device differently. Various layers of the object can also be shown while users move the device away and toward themselves. Our approach is real-time, completely mobile (running on Android) and does not depend on external sensor/displays (e.g., camera and projector).},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach for online UI adaptation that aims to overcome the limitations of the most commonly used UI optimization method involving multiple objectives: weighted sum optimization. Weighted sums are highly sensitive to objective formulation, limiting the effectiveness of UI adaptations. We propose ParetoAdapt, an adaptation approach that uses online multi-objective optimization with a posteriori articulated preferences—that is, articulation of preferences after the optimization has concluded—to make UI adaptation robust to incomplete and inaccurate objective formulations. It offers users a flexible way to control adaptations by selecting from a set of Pareto optimal adaptation proposals and adjusting them to fit their needs. We showcase the feasibility and flexibility of ParetoAdapt by implementing an online layout adaptation system in a state-of-the-art 3D UI adaptation framework. We further evaluate its robustness and run-time in simulation-based experiments that allow us to systematically change the accuracy of the estimated user preferences. We conclude by discussing how our approach may impact the usability and practicality of online UI adaptations.},

abstract = {AirConstellations supports a unique semi-fixed style of cross-device interactions via multiple self-spatially-aware armatures to which users can easily attach (or detach) tablets and other devices. In particular, AirConstellations affords highly flexible and dynamic device formations where the users can bring multiple devices together in-air&nbsp;—&nbsp;with 2–5 armatures poseable in 7DoF within the same workspace&nbsp;—&nbsp;to suit the demands of their current task, social situation, app scenario, or mobility needs. This affords an interaction metaphor where relative orientation, proximity, attaching (or detaching) devices, and continuous movement into and out of ad-hoc ensembles can drive context-sensitive interactions. Yet all devices remain self-stable in useful configurations even when released in mid-air. We explore flexible physical arrangement, feedforward of transition options, and layering of devices in-air across a variety of multi-device app scenarios. These include video conferencing with flexible arrangement of the person-space of multiple remote participants around a shared task-space, layered and tiled device formations with overview+detail and shared-to-personal transitions, and flexible composition of UI panels and tool palettes across devices for productivity applications. A preliminary interview study highlights user reactions to AirConstellations, such as for minimally disruptive device formations, easier physical transitions, and balancing ”seeing and being seen” in remote work.},

abstract = {Multi-display environments compose displays that can be at different locations from and different angles to the user; as a result, it can become very difficult to manage windows, read text, and manipulate objects. We investigate the idea of perspective as a way to solve these problems in multi-display environments. We first identify basic display and control factors that are affected by perspective, such as visibility, fracture, and sharing. We then present the design and implementation of E-conic, a multi-display multi-user environment that uses location data about displays and users to dynamically correct perspective. We carried out a controlled experiment to test the benefits of perspective correction in basic interaction tasks like targeting, steering, aligning, pattern-matching and reading. Our results show that perspective correction significantly and substantially improves user performance in all these tasks.},

In such environments, which have become popular recently, the point-of-gaze should be estimated on multiple screens. Therefore, we propose a cross-ratio based gaze estimation using a polarization camera for multiple screens. The point-of-gaze can be estimated on each monitor by identifying the screen reflected on the corneal surface at a polarization angle. Near-infrared light emitting diodes (NIR-LEDs) attached to the display are not required. This means that standard displays can be used with high general versatility as an advantage.},

By using multiple OptRods, the PC can simultaneously operate many output devices without any signal lines. Moreover, we can arrange surfaces of various shapes easily by combining multiple OptRods.

abstract = {Instrumented with multiple depth cameras and projectors, LightSpace is a small room installation designed to explore a variety of interactions and computational strategies related to interactive displays and the space that they inhabit. LightSpace cameras and projectors are calibrated to 3D real world coordinates, allowing for projection of graphics correctly onto any surface visible by both camera and projector. Selective projection of the depth camera data enables emulation of interactive displays on un-instrumented surfaces (such as a standard table or office desk), as well as facilitates mid-air interactions between and around these displays. For example, after performing multi-touch interactions on a virtual object on the tabletop, the user may transfer the object to another display by simultaneously touching the object and the destination display. Or the user may "pick up" the object by sweeping it into their hand, see it sitting in their hand as they walk over to an interactive wall display, and "drop" the object onto the wall by touching it with their other hand. We detail the interactions and algorithms unique to LightSpace, discuss some initial observations of use and suggest future directions.},

abstract = {Users increasingly interact with a heterogeneous collection of computing devices. The applications that users employ on those devices, however, still largely provide user experiences that assume the use of a single computer. This failure is due in part to the difficulty of creating user experiences that span multiple devices, particularly the need to manage identifying, connecting to, and communicating with other devices. In this paper we present an infrastructure based on instant messaging that simplifies adding that additional functionality to applications. Our infrastructure elevates device ownership to a first class property, allowing developers to provide functionality that spans personal devices without writing code to manage users' devices or establish connections among them. It also provides simple mechanisms for applications to send information, events, or commands between a user's devices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our infrastructure by presenting a set of sample applications built with it and a user study demonstrating that developers new to the infrastructure can implement all of the cross-device functionality for three applications in, on average, less than two and a half hours.},

In this paper, we present GazeProjector, a system that combines (1) natural feature tracking on displays to determine the mobile eye tracker's position relative to a display with (2) accurate point-of-gaze estimation. GazeProjector allows for seam-less gaze estimation and interaction on multiple displays of arbitrary sizes independently of the user's position and orientation to the display. In a user study with 12 partici-pants we compare GazeProjector to established methods (here: visual on-screen markers and a state-of-the-art video-based motion capture system). We show that our approach is robust to varying head poses, orientations, and distances to the display, while still providing high gaze estimation accuracy across multiple displays without re-calibration for each variation. Our system represents an important step towards the vision of pervasive gaze-based interfaces.},

These are patterns of activity, contributed by multiple users (or one user with multiple devices), which take on a new meaning when they occur together in time, or in a specific sequence in time. To explore this new area of inquiry, this work uses tablet computers augmented with touch sensors and two-axis linear accelerometers (tilt sensors). The devices are connected via an 802.11 wireless network and synchronize their time-stamped sensor data. This paper describes a few practical examples of interaction techniques using synchronous gestures such as dynamically tiling together displays by physically bumping them together, discusses implementation issues, and speculates on further possibilities for synchronous gestures.},

Our implementation adds no noticeable overhead to local copy and paste operations.},

abstract = {We present the satellite cursor - a novel technique that uses multiple cursors to improve pointing performance by reducing input movement. The satellite cursor associates every target with a separate cursor in its vicinity for pointing, which realizes the MAGIC (manual and gaze input cascade) pointing method without gaze tracking. We discuss the problem of visual clutter caused by multiple cursors and propose several designs to mitigate it. Two controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate satellite cursor performance in a simple reciprocal pointing task and a complex task with multiple targets of varying layout densities. Results show the satellite cursor can save significant mouse movement and consequently pointing time, especially for sparse target layouts, and that satellite cursor performance can be accurately modeled by Fitts' Law.},

abstract = {The construction of application-specific Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) still needs considerable programming partly because the mapping between application data and its visual representation is complicated. This study proposes a system which generates GUIs by generalizing multiple sets of application data and its visualization examples. The most notable characteristic of the system is that programmers can interactively modify the mapping by “correcting” the system-generated visualization examples that represent the system's current notion of programmer's intentions. Conflicting mappings are automatically resolved via the use of constraint hierarchies.},

abstract = {Systems of connected appliances, such as home theaters and presentation rooms, are becoming commonplace in our homes and workplaces. These systems are often difficult to use, in part because users must determine how to split the tasks they wish to perform into sub-tasks for each appliance and then find the particular functions of each appliance to complete their sub-tasks. This paper describes Huddle, a new system that automatically generates task-based interfaces for a system of multiple appliances based on models of the content flow within the multi-appliance system.},

We use novel display and interaction techniques such as simple hand gestures and touch screen input for explicit interaction and contextual body orientation and position cues for implicit interaction. Techniques are presented for subtle notification, self-revealing help, privacy controls, and shared use by multiple people each in their own context. Initial user feedback is also presented, and future directions discussed.},

Given a 3D model of the object and the structure of the cardboard to be reused, our system suggests the optimal net of a new box, which only requires minimum cuts and folds for fabrication by leveraging the edges of the input cardboard. To achieve this, we implemented a GUI visualizing the input models and the optimal net computed by our optimization algorithm. As a demonstration, we showed three design examples, with evaluation results of our method for reducing the length of cuts and folds.},

For example, a designer creating a skin for a music player must separately specify the appearance of the elements in the music player skin and the mapping between these visual elements and the functionality provided by the music player. This gap between appearance and semantic meaning creates a number of problems. We present a set of techniques that allows designers to use their preferred drawing tool to specify both appearance and semantic meaning. We demonstrate our techniques in an unmodified version of Adobe Photoshop®, but our techniques are general and adaptable to nearly any layered drawing package.},

In this paper, we introduce PacCAM, a system for packing 2D parts within a given source material for fabrication using 2D cutting machines. Our solution combines computer vision to capture the source material shape with a user interface that incorporates 2D rigid body simulation and snapping. A user study demonstrated that participants could make layouts faster with our system compared with using traditional drafting tools. PacCAM caters to a variety of 2D fabrication applications and can contribute to the reduction of material waste.},
