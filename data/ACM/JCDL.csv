To support exploratory search scenarios, MDN provides unconventional overviews for the content and introduces novel navigational queries. In a Diagram-to-Content query, a user clicks on diagram elements to retrieve related collection documents. Diagram-to-Diagram queries allows users to select diagram element(s) to see related elements highlighted in other diagrams. Content-to-Diagram queries highlight diagram elements related to document(s) selected by the user. MDN depends on manually created connections between diagram elements and collection documents. Therefore, only a small portion of the targeted collection might be accessible from the diagrams. In this paper, we extend the domain of MDN diagram-to-content queries to reach related collection documents not directly connected to the diagrams. We focus on Wikipedia as a case study and a class of diagrams with specific characteristics. We exploit the Wikipedia hyperlink graph and internal diagram structures to provide a diagram-influenced ranking of Wikipedia pages. We tested different settings for our ranking algorithm using 12 diagrams from six domains. The results showed the strong influence of diagrams on ranking and reasonably high similarity between diagram elements selected by the user and the top-10-ranked pages.},","Proceedings of the 18th ACM/IEEE on Joint Conference on Digital Libraries},","141–144},","4},","diagrams, exploratory search, faceted search, wikipedia},","Fort Worth, Texas, USA},",JCDL '18

The proposed method, i.e. finding the same records across multiple databases, will help users to know which organization has a certain record and its customized versions regardless of languages and differences in formats. Although the proposed approach was demonstrated on Japanese Ukiyo-e databases, it might be applicable to other disciplines for bridging the gaps between databases in different languages.},","Proceedings of the 14th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries},","193–196},","4},","Japanese arts, de-duplication, digital library, humanities databases, multilingual record linkage},","London, United Kingdom},",JCDL '14

On the other hand, different research fields---in fact, even different research areas within a single field---may have very different publishing patterns, which may not be well described by a single, global index. In this paper, we argue that productivity indices should account for the singularities of the publication patterns of different research areas, in order to produce an unbiased assessment of the impact of scientific research. Inspired by ranking aggregation approaches in distributed information retrieval, we propose a novel approach for ranking researchers across multiple research areas. Our approach is generic and produces cross-area versions of any global productivity index, such as the volume of publications, citation count and even the h-index. Our thorough evaluation considering multiple areas within the broad field of Computer Science shows that our cross-area indices outperform their global counterparts when assessed against the official ranking produced by CNPq, the Brazilian National Research Council for Scientific and Technological Development. As a result, this paper contributes a valuable mechanism to support the decisions of funding bodies and research agencies, for example, in any research assessment effort.},","Proceedings of the 13th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries},","97–106},","10},","bibliometric indicators, cross-disciplinarity, ranking aggregation, research performance},","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA},",JCDL '13

By aligning the output of multiple OCR engines and taking advantage of the differences between them, the error rate based on the aligned lattice of recognized words is significantly lower than the individual OCR word error rates. This lattice error rate constitutes a lower bound among aligned alternatives from the OCR output. Results from a collection of poor quality mid-twentieth century typewritten documents demonstrate an average reduction of 55.0% in the error rate of the lattice of alternatives and a realized word error rate (WER) reduction of 35.8% in a dictionary-based selection process. As an important precursor, an innovative admissible heuristic for the A* algorithm is developed, which results in a significant reduction in state space exploration to identify all optimal alignments of the OCR text output, a necessary step toward the construction of the word hypothesis lattice. On average 0.0079% of the state space is explored to identify all optimal alignments of the documents.},","Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries},","231–240},","10},","A* algorithm, OCR error rate reduction, text alignment},","Austin, TX, USA},",JCDL '09

In this paper, we present a framework named IFME (Information Filtering by Multiple Examples) in a digital library environment to help users identify the literature related to their interests by leveraging the Positive Unlabeled learning (PU learning). Using a few relevant documents provided by a user and considering the documents in an online database as unlabeled data (called U), it ranks the documents in U using a PU learning algorithm. From the experimental results, we found that while the approach performed well when a large set of relevant feedback documents were available, it performed relatively poor when the relevant feedback documents were few. We improved IFME by combining PU learning with under-sampling to tune the performance. Using Mean Average Precision (MAP), our experimental results indicated that with under-sampling, the performance improved significantly even when the size of P was small. We believe the PU learning based IFME framework brings insights to develop more effective digital library systems.},","Proceedings of the 13th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries},","107–110},","4},","information retrieval, positive unlabeled learning, relevance feedback, search by multiple examples, text classification},","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA},",JCDL '13
