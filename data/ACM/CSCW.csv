In the following I briefly introduce how this research seeks to spark a debate in CSCW by challenging contemporary ideals about software development outsourcing through the exploration of the multiplicities and asymmetric dynamics inherent in the collaborative work of GSD.,Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion,163–166,4,"GSD, Global software development, asymmetric dynamics, ethnography, incentives, infrastructure, local work practices, multiplicity, outsourcing","San Francisco, California, USA",CSCW '16 Companion

However, prior work has only considered problems with a single constraint, while many real-world problems involve multiple constraints. This paper contributes a systematic crowdsourcing approach for eliciting multiple constraints inherent in a problem and using those constraints to find inspirations useful in solving it. To do so we identify methods to elicit useful constraints at different levels of abstraction, and empirical results that identify how the level of abstraction influences creative idea generation. Our results show that crowds find the most useful inspirations when the problem domain is represented abstractly and constraints are represented more concretely.",Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work &amp; Social Computing,1236–1245,10,"problem-solving, inspiration, idea generation, Constraint","San Francisco, California, USA",CSCW '16

This paper explores the various ways in which people create and use multiple user representations, specifically in online games. Using 8 years of population data from a popular multiplayer online game, EVE Online, we examine how multiple character creation and use occurs at scale and how operationalization of individuals between accounts and characters impacts methods. We suggest that conceptualizing participants in online games based on the assumption that one character equals one individual can lead to incorrect analyses regarding the demographics or behaviors of the population. Additionally, social network analysis suggests that a character-centric, rather than account-level, viewpoint can change the results of statistical relationships with network metrics such as eigenvector centrality.",Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work &amp; Social Computing,648–663,16,"user representations, social network analysis, online games, Multiple profile maintenance","San Francisco, California, USA",CSCW '16

However, there is little agreement on a standard model for researching the performance of distributed teams. Initial pilot results suggest that the Multiple Errands Test (MET), when adapted to a team in a virtual environment, is a platform for evaluating the impact of feedback characteristics. To demonstrate the potential of the Team MET as a platform for future team research in the broader CSCW community, an example study is described in which team members are given feedback in one of four conditions: individual private, team private, individual public, and team public.",Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference Companion on Computer Supported Cooperative Work &amp; Social Computing,247–250,4,"teams, team feedback, feedback privacy, collaborative teams","Vancouver, BC, Canada",CSCW'15 Companion

In our approach, devices share context with each other, and form groups when these readings are found to be similar to one another. Through a formative study, we examine the limitations of using a single type of context to form groups, and show how leveraging multiple contexts improves our ability to detect and form relevant groupings. We then present DIDJA, a robust software toolkit that automatically collects and analyzes contextual information in order to find and form groups. Through two prototypes, we demonstrate how DIDJA enhances existing user experiences, and show how developers can use our toolkit to easily facilitate frictionless collaborations between users and their environment. We then perform an extended experiment and show how DIDJA is able to accurately form groups under realistic conditions.",Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work &amp; Social Computing,1612–1621,10,"mobile computing, middleware, context sharing","Vancouver, BC, Canada",CSCW '15

In observing people's interactions in the ""sprawling public sphere"" across multiple social media tools in both political and non-political spaces, we found that social media supported the interactional dimensions of deliberative democracy--the interaction with media and the interaction between people. People used multiple tools through which they: were serendipitously exposed to diverse political information, constructed diverse information feeds, disseminated diverse information, and engaged in respectful and reasoned political discussions with diverse audiences. When people's civic agency was inhibited when using a tool, they often adopted, or switched to, alternative media that could afford what they were trying to achieve. Contrary to the polarization perspective, we find that people were purposefully seeking diverse information and discussants. Some individuals altered their views as a result of the interactions they were having in the online public sphere.",Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work &amp; Social Computing,1409–1421,13,"depolarization, multi-mediation, public sphere, social media","Baltimore, Maryland, USA",CSCW '14
